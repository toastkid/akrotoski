  # Redirect plugin for Thoth
  #
  # Create a redirects.yml file in the root of your Thoth blog
  # and put the redirects you want in there, e.g.
  #
  #  ---
  #    /foo: /bar
  #    /some/thing: /some/thing.pdf
  #    # can use ramaze regex too: http://wiki.ramaze.net/Walkthrough#routing
  #    ^/(\d+)\.te?xt$: /text/%d # maps e.g. /123.text or /56.text to /text/123 and /text/56 respectively
  #
  # You'll need to tell Thoth to start the plugin when it starts, so make sure you have a 
  #   plugins ['redirect']
  # directive in your thoth.conf  
 
  #note - where you have urls with the same first part, use ^ and $ to make sure it pulls the whole thing in.
  #otherwise, /academic/phd is treated as /academic (regardless of the ordering in this file)
  
  ^/media$:                  /media_files
