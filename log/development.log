A mobile diary application was developed which allows participants to rapidly capture how serendipity happens in their daily life and the context in which they experience serendipity for one week. Their diary entries were discussed during post-study interviews.<br/><strong>Analysis.</strong>0240An Emergent Themes Analysis was conducted to understand our data.<br/><strong>Results.</strong>0240We identified: 1) some key elements to support understanding of serendipity, 2) the influential role of context in serendipitous experiences, 3) a framework of understanding how serendipity happens and 4) the positive impacts of serendipity in people&#8217;s information research.<br/><strong>Conclusions.</strong>0240Our research suggests that a framework for classifying serendipity should consider aspects associated with the activity, the value of the information, the source of the information and the interaction between the individual and the context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A wonderful, empirical close reading of serendipity that is (crucially) <em>user-centred</em>.

Simply, unlike the capacity to learn &#8211; which can be measured &#8211; social and psychological concepts that are difficult to measure, like serendipity, are too multifaceted to be programmed in a way that can scale for the current capacity of computer processors. Services that claim to generate serendipitous outcomes may produce something that mimics coincidence, but the attribution of serendipity is inherently too complex for current digital technologies to discern.</p>\n<p><b>defining the problem</b></p>\n<p>The problem is one of definition, and how to adequately represent this: such phenomena are socially, culturally, temporally, materially defined, thus databases that seek to reduce it by collecting data points and applying heuristic algorithms would expand exponentially if they tried to document as much as necessary to accurately replicate the serendipitous effect. Common constituents shared between people do help to locate an individual within certain parameters &#8211; country, demography, religious or political orientation, IQ, etc &#8211; but proportions of the components are unique to each person. Measuring the being human thus becomes a philosophical problem rather than a technological one.</p>\n<p>As we have discovered in the previous talks on this panel, serendipity is difficult to define because it relies upon the individual&#8217;s sense-making of a &#8220;happy accident&#8221; or the unexpected confluence of worlds (trickster). The current crop of &#8220;digital serendipity solutions&#8221; produce an avatar of &#8220;serendipity&#8221; based on discovery mechanism heuristics that do not account for the various environmental and individual elements that contribute to that attribution. Certainly the results might &#8220;pass&#8221; as serendipity, and this may be the desired effect for entities who wish to invest in this area, but their solutions are neither serendipitous nor scientific because the inputs they carer for pre-suppose a self-fulfilling &#8211; and non-accidental &#8211; outcome.</p>\n<p><b>how have</b></p>\n<p>Instead, a complex concept like serendipity can be more holistically represented and understood in a way that allows for what Law (2004) describes as &#8220;messiness,&#8221; or the array of elements that are difficult to reduce or to conventionally order or organise (Jungnickel, 2010).</p>\n<p>There are methods that seek to capture the messiness of human experience, particularly in the social sciences; for example, qualitative research analytic techniques in the psychological sciences, like Grounded Theory and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, seek to understand the experience of the individual, and ethnographic work, primarily used in sociology and anthropology, explore the sense-making processes employed by groups by examining texts and objects produced by participants in social systems. Yet even these methods fall short of being able to convey the outcomes, particularly because of the agendas and ideologies imbued in the written word (Sellen &amp; Harper, 2001; Krotoski, in press) as the resulting sense-making by the researcher(s) is commonly reduced into text-based interpretations that are static.</p>\n<p><b>how to &#8220;make sense&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>An alternative method, practiced by Jungnickel and McHardy (2010) explores dynamic systems of sense-making by producing physical interpretations of data and theory, encouraging an ongoing, collaborative and reflexive understanding of the aspects of experience we are unable to measure or control.

It is an &#8220;engine&#8221; rather than a machine because, although it has a form and a function with a purpose &#8211; to render visible the cultural, temporal and material processes in generating a serendipitous outcome &#8211; it will transform the essential properties of the input.

This will be a dynamic and interactive entity made from scrounged materials, curated to represent &#8220;mess&#8221;. Our interpretation will focus on the &#8220;insight&#8221; element of the definition evolved by the SerenA project and other research in this area.</p>\n<p>This will represent the social and psychological discourse upon which interpretations of value will subsequently be added.</p>\n<p>2) To emphasise the locativity of the definition, we will seek &#8220;apps&#8221; from practitioners in different countries that can be appended to the core engine. These will demonstrate to users that the interpretations of serendipity are locally oriented.</p>\n<p>3) There will be a series of open salon events in which commissioned artists, researchers and others will be asked to create a perforative piece or lecture for a public audience that is based on their interpretation of the theme &#8220;serendipity&#8221;. The objective is to &#8220;generate&#8221; serendipitous encounters between attendees across four dimensions: inspired by the interaction between audience member and object, between audience member and presenter, audience members inspired by object, and audience members not inspired by object.</p>\n<p>This form is closest to the solutions designed by engineers, subject to the curatorial filtering and considered placement of &#8220;inputs&#8221; (commissioned presenters) in order to produce output.</p>\n<p><b>conclusion</b></p>\n<p>As a technology, the Serendipity Engine seeks to insert messiness into the process of defining a value-laden human phenomenon. Through the process of forming and re-forming this analogue &#8220;solution&#8221; for a problem that is increasingly gaining value amongst commercial software developers, the aim is to render visible other factors that could produce more inclusive digital technologies that better-represent being human in code.</p>\n<p><b>references</b><br />\nJungnickel, K.

The good news is that <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/11057400816/a-user-centred-mobile-diary-study-approach-to\">they are too</a>.\r\n\r\nHere's the talk I gave at the panel:\r\n\r\n<b>Beautiful Machines: A sense-making methodology for serendipitous discovery</b>\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive research exploring how to build digital technologies that can mimic human processes like learning and logic, but this paper takes as its starting point that the phenomenological experience of being human is not replicable in the digital environment. Simply, unlike the capacity to learn - which can be measured - social and psychological concepts that are difficult to measure, like serendipity, are too multifaceted to be programmed in a way that can scale for the current capacity of computer processors. Services that claim to generate serendipitous outcomes may produce something that mimics coincidence, but the attribution of serendipity is inherently too complex for current digital technologies to discern. \r\n\r\n<b>defining the problem</b>\r\n\r\nThe problem is one of definition, and how to adequately represent this: such phenomena are socially, culturally, temporally, materially defined, thus databases that seek to reduce it by collecting data points and applying heuristic algorithms would expand exponentially if they tried to document as much as necessary to accurately replicate the serendipitous effect. Common constituents shared between people do help to locate an individual within certain parameters - country, demography, religious or political orientation, IQ, etc - but proportions of the components are unique to each person. Measuring the being human thus becomes a philosophical problem rather than a technological one.\r\n\r\nAs we have discovered in the previous talks on this panel, serendipity is difficult to define because it relies upon the individual's sense-making of a \"happy accident\" or the unexpected confluence of worlds (trickster). The current crop of \"digital serendipity solutions\" produce an avatar of \"serendipity\" based on discovery mechanism heuristics that do not account for the various environmental and individual elements that contribute to that attribution. Certainly the results might \"pass\" as serendipity, and this may be the desired effect for entities who wish to invest in this area, but their solutions are neither serendipitous nor scientific because the inputs they carer for pre-suppose a self-fulfilling - and non-accidental - outcome.\r\n\r\n<b>how have</b>\r\n\r\nInstead, a complex concept like serendipity can be more holistically represented and understood in a way that allows for what Law (2004) describes as \"messiness,\" or the array of elements that are difficult to reduce or to conventionally order or organise (Jungnickel, 2010). \r\n\r\nThere are methods that seek to capture the messiness of human experience, particularly in the social sciences; for example, qualitative research analytic techniques in the psychological sciences, like Grounded Theory and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, seek to understand the experience of the individual, and ethnographic work, primarily used in sociology and anthropology, explore the sense-making processes employed by groups by examining texts and objects produced by participants in social systems. Yet even these methods fall short of being able to convey the outcomes, particularly because of the agendas and ideologies imbued in the written word (Sellen & Harper, 2001; Krotoski, in press) as the resulting sense-making by the researcher(s) is commonly reduced into text-based interpretations that are static. \r\n\r\n<b>how to \"make sense\"</b>\r\n\r\nAn alternative method, practiced by Jungnickel and McHardy (2010) explores dynamic systems of sense-making by producing physical interpretations of data and theory, encouraging an ongoing, collaborative and reflexive understanding of the aspects of experience we are unable to measure or control. They are creating a series of \"Enquiry Machines\" that are an assemblage of human, non-human and conceptual components aimed at, \"drawing attention to the material nature of enquiry420046 an attempt to critically examine practice420046a metaphor in action.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/15224631?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/15224631\">Enquiry Machine #1 - Making</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/katjung\">Kat Jungnickel</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\nThe function of performative methods that \"make real\" are multifold, serving the researchers' sense-making and demonstrating the viewers and users the conceptual complexity involved in the social phenomenon under consideration. The processes which Jungnickel documents in her ethnographic performative practices, including the development of Enquiry Machine No 1, \"open[s] up alternate means of interrogating [her] ideas.\" She describes the reflexivity for the researcher involved in the choice of materials, the spatial configurations and the locations of display and the \"messy, dynamic and collaboratively produced\" evolution of the meaning of the research objects (including text, video, imagery, physical object) as viewers make \"informal and serendipitous connections\" and transform the display.\r\n\r\n<b>making sense for them</b>\r\n\r\n!http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wkgIzuqJM0w/TN_BiBwPxjI/AAAAAAAAHLM/Fz3DYjKKeiU/strogatz.detailed.533.jpg!:http://www.zerohedge.com/article/welcome-machine\r\n\r\nThe sense-making by individuals towards the content is also represented in other machines that have had research and artistic agendas. The MONIAC computer was an analogue computer devised and built by a sociology graduate with an interest in economic principles as a demonstration tool for classrooms, and which became a predictive tool for governments and commercial organisations. \r\n\r\nCreated in 1949 by William Phillips in his spare time, the MONIAC is approximately 2 metres high, 1 metre wide and 1 metre deep. Its components include a series of found transparent plastic tanks and pipes affixed to a wooden board that contained different-coloured water that flowed between tanks to represent economic principles and the setting for economic parameters like tax and investment rates. It made visible the hidden inter-relationships between variables. Phillips' computer was his method for translating the language of economics into hydraulics, \"from a language he didn't understand into a language which he did.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bXBuWUQ24vU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThe computer succeeded in its objective: \"It was such a supreme visual telling of the mechanics of the Keynsian idea that I think all students felt for the first time they started to understand what the basic ideas were all about.\" Dr Brian Henry, Director of the Centre for the Centre for International Macroeconomics, Oxford University\r\n\r\n<b>making sense for her</b>\r\n\r\n!http://dbprng00ikc2j.cloudfront.net/work/image/188183/abagl8/forgiveness_machine_1.jpg!:http://www.beautifulcrap.com\r\n\r\nArtist Karen Green's series of prints of fictional machines represents another kind of sense-making different from Phillips', Jungnickel's and McHardy's: their objects explained \"objective\" principles by seeking to unpick the principles according to theory, while Green's machines represent a sense-making that is subjective and intended to represent a personal working-through of a concept. The Forgiveness Machine was developed in response to her husband's suicide and the need to process that event. \"420034The forgiveness machine was seven-feet long,420035 she says, 420034with lots of weird plastic bits and pieces. Heavy as hell.420035 The idea was that you wrote down the thing that you wanted to forgive, or to be forgiven for, and a vacuum sucked your piece of paper in one end. At the other it was shredded, and hey presto.\" When physically re-created and put on display in an art gallery, the reaction had qualities similar to the machines previously described, instilling a sense of connection with the principles on display (emotional, conceptual).\r\n\r\n<i>The machine was overwhelmed, too; it couldn't process all the requests and was eventually dismantled. \"Forgiving is never as easy as we would like,\" she says. \"Apparently quite a lot of people cried.\"</i> \r\n- <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/10/karen-green-david-foster-wallace-interview\">The Guardian, 11 April 2011</a>\r\n\r\n<b>making sense of serendipity</b>\r\n\r\nThe Serendipity Engine, a collaboration with Jungnickel, is the second in the Enquiry Machine series, and similarly seeks to render visible the multiple socio-material-technical (and I would add, psychological) processes that are invested in the attribution of serendipity. It is an \"engine\" rather than a machine because, although it has a form and a function with a purpose - to render visible the cultural, temporal and material processes in generating a serendipitous outcome - it will transform the essential properties of the input. It will irrevocably convert the ins and transform them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine. \r\n\r\n<i>It will change the nature of chance by inspiring insight in order that value is attributed to the experience.</i>\r\n\r\nThe \"engine\" will have three forms: \r\n\r\n1) Jungnickel and I will develop a physical \"core\" that is based upon the current body of research that seeks to define the socio-cultural, psychological, technological and material nature of serendipity. This will be a dynamic and interactive entity made from scrounged materials, curated to represent \"mess\". Our interpretation will focus on the \"insight\" element of the definition evolved by the SerenA project and other research in this area. \r\n\r\nThis will represent the social and psychological discourse upon which interpretations of value will subsequently be added.\r\n\r\n2) To emphasise the locativity of the definition, we will seek \"apps\" from practitioners in different countries that can be appended to the core engine. These will demonstrate to users that the interpretations of serendipity are locally oriented.\r\n\r\n3) There will be a series of open salon events in which commissioned artists, researchers and others will be asked to create a perforative piece or lecture for a public audience that is based on their interpretation of the theme \"serendipity\". The objective is to \"generate\" serendipitous encounters between attendees across four dimensions: inspired by the interaction between audience member and object, between audience member and presenter, audience members inspired by object, and audience members not inspired by object.\r\n\r\nThis form is closest to the solutions designed by engineers, subject to the curatorial filtering and considered placement of \"inputs\" (commissioned presenters) in order to produce output.\r\n\r\n<b>conclusion</b>\r\n\r\nAs a technology, the Serendipity Engine seeks to insert messiness into the process of defining a value-laden human phenomenon. Through the process of forming and re-forming this analogue \"solution\" for a problem that is increasingly gaining value amongst commercial software developers, the aim is to render visible other factors that could produce more inclusive digital technologies that better-represent being human in code.\r\n\r\n<b>references</b>\r\nJungnickel, K.

Are they the same in terms of form and function?</p>\n<p><strong>Raging against the machine</strong></p>\n<p>A few frantic brainstormed notes that I just scribbled down say, &#8220;Machines are objects that you use to &#8216;do&#8217; something; they have an <em>objective</em>: render visible, create an output, solve a problem, demonstrate. A machine has an input and an output.&#8221; These hastily-considered parameters frame the construction of the thing: it has to have an in, where things are <em>introduced</em>, and an out, where things are <em>produced</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\">OED</a> defines a &#8220;machine&#8221; as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A material structure designed for a specific purpose, and related uses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>and</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>An apparatus constructed to perform a task or for some other purpose; also in derived senses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>In other words, a machine has a <em>purpose</em>. It has to <em>perform</em>. It has a <em>function</em>.0240It must <em>do</em> something. Will the Serendipity Engine <em>do</em>0240anything? Well, yes. <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/8637791073/the-problem-with-digital-serendipity-solutions-notes\">Kat &amp; I have agreed</a> that it has to render visible the social, cultural, temporal and material processes involved in generating a serendipitous outcome.0240</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Form and function</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>According to these definitions, it also has to have a physicality.

In fact:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A conceptual, abstract, or theoretical mechanism or device; spec. a model or mathematical abstraction of an existing or hypothetical computer. Cf. Turing Machine.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>But its constituent parts must be.</span></p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Engine=Machine?</strong></p>\n<p><span>An engine is one type of machine. The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62223?rskey=6Wdgz3&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid\">OED</a> defines it as &#8220;A machine, contraption, or mechanism.&#8221; Therefore in order to fit into the category, it must have a function, a purpose, an input and an output in order to demonstrate the concept and/or abstraction of the preceding verbal descriptor, <em>serendipity</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span>But what are the unique elements of an engine? Does an engine <em>do</em> something unique to other machines? The definitions of the word decree that an engine <em>transforms</em> something into something else:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A complicated machine with moving parts, for producing a given physical effect,0240esp. the conversion of power into motion.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>It propels things forward by converting a raw material into energy (steam, water etc), it calculates (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine\">Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine</a>), it computes (game engine). A machine can do something without transforming the essential properties of the input, like move something from A to B, but <strong>an engine is a subcategory that takes the0240ins and irrevocably converts them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>We have to make something that changes the essential nature of social experience into a serendipitous outcome.

It's all very exciting.\r\n\r\nHere's an overview:<blockquote>The overall theme of the three-lecture series is \"Connections,\" focussing on the evolution of innovation as a process of social production enhanced by our interpersonal and informational connections. Recently, technology has contributed to this process, as a platform, a conduit and an articulation of existing networks and pathways. What impact does this have on our understanding and production of knowledge, culture and society?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayEvent&id=1180\">Kat and I</a> will be unveiling the physical <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com\">Serendipity Engine</a> that we've been working on for the last few months on <b>Tuesday 8 November</b>. We ask how the digital connections of the Web affect our opportunity to bump into and make the most of happy accidents. Come ready to poke & pull at the machine.\r\n\r\nOn <b>Tuesday 15 November</b>, science historian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_(science_historian)\">James Burke</a>, one of my personal heroes, will present his lecture, <i>1 + 1 = 3</i>. James is an incredible storyteller, and his extended monologues to camera in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcSxL8GUn-g\">BBC series Connections</a> still astound me for his memory skill and their conceptual dexterity.\r\n\r\nDetails & booking for James' talk are <a href=\"http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayEvent&id=1201\">here</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>James Burke takes a sideways look at the connective nature of innovation and its social effects. Two ideas come together to produce something that is greater than the sum of  the parts. The result is almost a surprise (in the way, for instance,  the first typewriters boosted the divorce rate!).\r\n\r\nInnovation has usually attempted to solve some aspect of the problem with which we have lived for two million tool-using years: scarcity. As a result, our institutions, value systems, modes of thought and behaviour have all been shaped by the fact that there's never been enough of everything to go around.\r\n\r\nHowever, thanks to the internet and a radically-accelerated rate of connective, inter-disciplinary innovation, we may be on the verge of solving the problem of scarcity once and for all. In ways that may really surprise us. What will abundance do to us?

We have a mutual obsession with serendipity.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, many of our conversations have glanced on the concept; some have been recorded for posterity (on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2011/may/03/tech-weekly-art-love-bin-laden\">The Guardian&#8217;s Tech Weekly podcast</a> and on social media), others have been lost in the ephemera of meatspace. And while Chris concurs with my blue-sky social scientific conceptualisation, his work as a programmer has placed pragmatic limitations on how serendipity can actually be applied in cold, hard, binary (virtual) reality.</p>\n<p>Chris&#8217; work as a research scientist/technologist has evolved into an interest in large databases and the ways they can be used to help people discover new things. Case in point, Artfinder is a service that, using a database of all of the art in museums around the world, ostensibly helps people bump up into new art that they would probably like.</p>\n<p>This precisely sums up my problem with so-called digital serendipity solutions. And so this is precisely what Chris, Kat and I talked about.</p>\n<p>In the process, we landed on two key things:</p>\n<ul><li>to maximise the experience of happy accidents, web designers should curate not-quite-right solutions and let consumers do the processing</li>\n<li>it&#8217;s possible to produce coincidence online, but it&#8217;s <em>not</em> possible to engineer serendipity because we are always too active to achieve <em>flow</em></li>\n</ul><p>Here&#8217;s more:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\n<p><em><strong><!-- more --></strong></em></p>\nHow To Produce Web-Based Happy Accidents</strong></em></p>\n<p>Serendipity is &#8220;too important a mechanism to ignore,&#8221; says Chris, but the way the web works is as a <strong>filter</strong> - designed to give a specific answer - which ignores serendipity. This is a linear approach.</p>\n<p>He sees his alternative as <strong><em>curatorial</em></strong> - designed to give an outcome in which the result is a collection of &#8220;objects&#8221;. The connections and analyses - that which ultimately produces the sagacity which in turn returns the value (to the beneficiary) of serendipity - are the consumer&#8217;s responsibility. The pathway branches.</p>\n<p><strong>A branching pathway is much more difficult to code because it doesn&#8217;t scale.</strong></p>\n<p>Chris believes that the question we must ask as consumers is how we want to discover.</p>\n<p>On this concept, our conversation turned to <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/\">Matt Jones</a>, co-founder of travel-based social networking site <a href=\"http://www.dopplr.com\">Dopplr</a> &amp; now one of the principles at London design studio <a href=\"http://berglondon.com\">Berg</a>. Matt <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/2009/02/18/exporting-the-past-into-the-future-or-the-possibility-jelly-lives-on-the-hypersurface-of-the-present/\">described my own predilection nicely</a> in a post about to maximise coincidence (note: I didn&#8217;t say serendipity) based on physical location. This tweet from his stream (in the post) sums it up nicely:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://magicalnihilism.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/twitter-_-matt-jones_-i-still-maintain-perhaps.png?w=676&amp;h=430\" align=\"middle\" height=\"291\" width=\"458\"/></p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://scraplab.net/2009/02/06/hereish-nowish/\">Hereish/Nowish/Soonish/Good Enough</a>&#8221; aren&#8217;t being built into technological solutions because there&#8217;s a fetishisation of precision. For example, we don&#8217;t get search results that seem off the mark; we discarded services that didn&#8217;t offer relevance long ago.</p>\n<p>In his post, Matt argues that the future cannot be automated, but future <em>coincidences</em> might occur because of the future intentionality Dopplr users share with people they trust.0240</p>\n<p>BUT. A <em>serendipitous</em> discovery might occur via Dopplr because the system&#8217;s accompanying &#8220;visualisations, tips,  statistics and other tools&#8221; allow you to &#8220;reflect on your past travels&#8221;. This is a bedrock upon which  sagacity might bloom. It produces the methods and materials for you to make the connections yourself, drawing on your self-knowledge.</p>\n<p>Chris wants developers to complicate their creations even more: forcing  awkward connections by juxtaposing &#8220;unrelated&#8221; (but <em>thematic</em>)  content. But this demands thoughtfulness from the perspective of the <strong>curator-developer</strong>. It means that they must blend the randomness in so people don&#8217;t think of it as error.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anti-Flow</strong></em></p>\n<p>Is the web itself the problem? We are so active as we traverse across it that we can&#8217;t experience the magnificent <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29\">flow</a></em> (<span class=\"citation book\">see <a href=\"http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4751.asp\">Csikszentmihalyi</a>&#8217;s publications)</span>, allowing our minds bimble as we do something else utterly immersive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Flow</strong> is the <a title=\"Mental state\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state\">mental state</a> of operation in which a person in  an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full  involvement, and success in the process of the activity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I experience flow most frequently when I&#8217;m running or cycling through the city streets. What is exceptionally flow-ful is that when I am utterly physically focussed on not getting killed by a taxi, a bus or a truck, my mind is able to wander and process something else. I guess this is <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/5219111468/an-incomplete-list-of-serendipity-necessities-v1\">what Steven Johnson means</a> when he says one of the ingredients in the Good Idea Recipe is to take A Creative Walk, or A Hot Bath.</p>\n<p><strong>We can&#8217;t do that online.</strong> We go online to find stuff out, to do things. Our HeadRAM is totally taken up with these tasks and cannot wander, process, make lateral connections. We are fully occupied, but not in a way that encourages us to think about or make sense of anything else.</p>\n<p>&#8212;-</p>\n<p>My big question is, <strong>do developers really <em>want</em> to create serendipity? I think the answer is no. </strong>I think they want to create discovery machines that provide solutions to consumers because that&#8217;s why consumers go to the Web.</p>\n<p>Discovery can be managed, engineered, programmed. Serendipity - occasionally the product of discovery - cannot.</p>", :title=>"Curating in the anti-Flow.

We talked about a lot of things - talks we&#8217;re giving, building materials we need, dream design projects we&#8217;d like to work on - but most importantly we decided two things:</p>\n<p>024002400240 42004202400240 0240how the Serendipity Engine fits into the Enquiry Machine series<br/>02400240 024042004202400240 0240what&#8217;s problematic about the processes the technologists are using to build their serendipity engines</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.enquirymachines.com/\">The Enquiry Machines series</a> (aka &#8220;instruments of enquiry&#8221;) seeks to render visible the processes of enquiry. As Kat describes, &#8220;by making something visible, you ask the audience to ask questions about it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Our starting point in this EM#2 is to take as a framework/starting point <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>the Web</strong>. In this research project we&#8217;re seeking to understand <em>how serendipity is currently missing from the knowledge production environment</em>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, <strong>we seek to disrupt a culture that</strong> (we feel) <strong>frames the serendipity experience as solution-driven</strong>: the &#8220;serendipity engine&#8221; that commercial digital organisations (from Google to Artfinder) are trying to create will answer questions about how to produce serendipitous answers and outcomes. The engines they will produce will be self-fulfilling because they will be embedded in the ideologies of what are considered valid and relevant &#8220;answers&#8221; and &#8220;outcomes&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Their inputs will anticipate their outputs.</strong></p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound like accidental discovery to me. Nor does it sound like sound science.</p>\n<p><strong>Furthermore, we have no idea what those inputs are, or what they  are (explicitly or implicitly) motivated by.</strong></p>\n<p>Full disclosure: this project does have an output that is defined as serendipity. This has been a matter of debate between Kat and I. But the way we have come to terms with this is that our approach will render visible the processes that lead to our defined serendipity outcome, <em>not</em> occlude them. Serendipity must be defined in order to establish the frame through  which to identify the variables that can be used to enquire about it.  The definition can necessarily include what it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><strong>The nature of the Enquiry Machines is to inquire about enquiry</strong>: the outcome is itself the question. Thus, the Serendipity Engine demands that the outcome be the realisation (or not) of serendipity.0240</p>\n<p>We are currently establishing the basic theoretical infrastructure, identifying the independent variables described in social theory (our particular specialty) that have been found to contribute to an outcome of serendipity.</p>\n<p>In future, we hope to expand this infrastructure by enlisting people from other disciplines, approaches, frameworks, cultures, perspectives (from particle physics to mathematics to baking to knitting to performance to sound to art to pathological lying) to help define the inputs that will go into the engine. The reason we will open this out is because any leaderboard of what best predicts a serendipitous outcome will very likely change with each new input. That&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>The process of enquiry is not fixed.

I am a social psychologist. I feel like I&#8217;m in a confessional. I am a social psychologist. And my bag, as it were, is social influence. Specifically, the influence that Web users exert over one another via the Web.</p>\n<p>My goodness, I can hear you say: that&#8217;s <i>exactly</i> our bread and butter! Well that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s &#8211; at least on the surface &#8211; a very good fit.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m here to tell you that the Web that you are creating &#8211; through your apps and services, your content and campaigns &#8211; is broken, and it is breaking more every time you help someone find what they&#8217;re looking for online. <b>Everything you do that gives someone what they want (or, indeed, the appearance of something they want) is undermining the original ethos of the communication technology that is revolutionising how we interact with one another</b>.</p>\n<p>Before I go in for the kill, let me back up a little bit.</p>\n<p><b>The Web is Made of Tubes</b><br />\nThe Web is an agnostic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes\">series of tubes</a> &#8211; yes tubes &#8211; that allow us to communicate. It was developed, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/10/rushes-sequences-tim-bernersle.shtml\">Tim Berners-Lee said</a>, to fulfill a need: a very lazy need to get stuff from other people without needed to actually speak with them.</p>\n<p>What has fascinated me about this technology is how it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">holds a mirror up to us</a>: it tells us what we value, it tells us what we want, it tells us something almost essential about what it means to be human.</p>\n<p>In my own research, I&#8217;ve discovered that <i>we form groups and communities in this space for the exact same reasons as we do offline</i>: to belong, to feel safe, to find out how we define ourselves according to who we deem to be similar and who we deem to be different. We cluster around attitudes and behaviours, forming communities of practice that transcend national boundaries, colour, socio-economic status, creed, age or gender.</p>\n<p>This is the original ethos of the Web.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the science bit.</p>\n<p><b>The Science Bit: Online Relationships and Attitude &amp; Behaviour Change</b><br />\n<b>We form relationships for the same reasons as we do offline</b> &#8211; and in much the same way: we seek out people who are similar to ourselves, with whom we can share experiences that form the basis of strong emotional bonds. We choose to be friends with people we meet regularly, reciprocally divulging information about ourselves in a way that heightens our similarity to one another, and encourages us to divulge even more information.</p>\n<p>There is a difference here: the medium &#8211; because it&#8217;s computer-mediated and therefore has <i>fewer interpersonal cues than meeting in meatspace</i> &#8211; fosters the sense that we are somehow less prone to the consequences of our actions (whether we are anonymous or use our real names), and so &#8211; despite the headlines &#8211; we have a tendency to be <b>more open and honest with online friends</b> than with their offline counterparts, and <b>we believe other people are being more open an honest with us too</b>.</p>\n<p>This allows us to generate strong feelings of <b>trust</b> more rapidly online, which in turn leads to a sense that another person is <b>credible</b> source of information, which in turn leads to <b>influence</b>.</p>\n<p>In fact, <b>we do attitude and behaviour change in the same way as offline</b>: <i>we are influenced by the people we know whom we compare ourselves with</i>, and whom we view as typical of our social identities &#8211; that sense of who we are and which group we belong to.</p>\n<p>But because we have less information about the other people online &#8211; we have a tendency to <i>conform</i> to the attitudes and behaviours that people whom we (superficially) believe are more like us demonstrate.</p>\n<p>But even more fascinating, we are more likely to fill in the blanks about people&#8217;s attitudes based on what we think they think, often perceiving their attitudes as <i>more extremely similar</i> to ourselves than they actually are.</p>\n<p>And so what we have online is <b>social conformity based on a social pressure that more than likely doesn&#8217;t exist or is believed to be something than it is</b>.</p>\n<p>What a house of cards.</p>\n<p><b>Silencing Serendpity</b><br />\nSo what happens when you combine these tendencies with the extrordinary world wide web &#8211; an information repository so vast that it&#8217;s impossible to parse it in a meaningful way? A library of information that demands filters because it&#8217;s so enormous, otherwise it would be as utterly useless as a novel of words rearranged in a completely random order?</p>\n<p>How on earth does Joe or Jane Web user decide which content to look at and what to be influenced by?</p>\n<p>Well, as a social psychologist, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s <b>social influence</b>.</p>\n<p>And web developers are getting pretty wise to this. You don&#8217;t have to look far to see them trying to do it: first the focus of the success of a website was about getting eyeballs through developing community. More recently, it was about personalising search, and encouraging social searching services. The premise was that you&#8217;d be more likely to believe the information that was delivered to you from someone you viewed as similar, trustworthy and credible.

I'm pleased it produced some thinking.\r\n\r\nThe text is below. The content is a first stab at a more robust thesis I'm working on, and so I would welcome your comments.\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather watch my keynote dance instead (I have a tendency to flap my arms around and stride up and down the stage when I give talks), the IAB has published the <a href=\"http://iabplayer.iabuk.net/default.aspx?videoID=3138\">video</a>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHello and thank you for inviting me to open this exciting event. I am a social psychologist. I feel like I'm in a confessional. I am a social psychologist. And my bag, as it were, is social influence. Specifically, the influence that Web users exert over one another via the Web.\r\n\r\nMy goodness, I can hear you say: that's <i>exactly</i> our bread and butter! Well that's great. It's - at least on the surface - a very good fit.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm here to tell you that the Web that you are creating - through your apps and services, your content and campaigns - is broken, and it is breaking more every time you help someone find what they're looking for online. <b>Everything you do that gives someone what they want (or, indeed, the appearance of something they want) is undermining the original ethos of the communication technology that is revolutionising how we interact with one another</b>.\r\n\r\nBefore I go in for the kill, let me back up a little bit.\r\n\r\n<b>The Web is Made of Tubes</b>\r\nThe Web is an agnostic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes\">series of tubes</a> - yes tubes - that allow us to communicate. It was developed, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/10/rushes-sequences-tim-bernersle.shtml\">Tim Berners-Lee said</a>, to fulfill a need: a very lazy need to get stuff from other people without needed to actually speak with them.\r\n\r\nWhat has fascinated me about this technology is how it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">holds a mirror up to us</a>: it tells us what we value, it tells us what we want, it tells us something almost essential about what it means to be human.\r\n\r\nIn my own research, I've discovered that <i>we form groups and communities in this space for the exact same reasons as we do offline</i>: to belong, to feel safe, to find out how we define ourselves according to who we deem to be similar and who we deem to be different. We cluster around attitudes and behaviours, forming communities of practice that transcend national boundaries, colour, socio-economic status, creed, age or gender.\r\n\r\nThis is the original ethos of the Web.\r\n\r\nBut here's the science bit.\r\n\r\n<b>The Science Bit: Online Relationships and Attitude & Behaviour Change</b>\r\n<b>We form relationships for the same reasons as we do offline</b> - and in much the same way: we seek out people who are similar to ourselves, with whom we can share experiences that form the basis of strong emotional bonds. We choose to be friends with people we meet regularly, reciprocally divulging information about ourselves in a way that heightens our similarity to one another, and encourages us to divulge even more information. \r\n\r\nThere is a difference here: the medium - because it's computer-mediated and therefore has <i>fewer interpersonal cues than meeting in meatspace</i> - fosters the sense that we are somehow less prone to the consequences of our actions (whether we are anonymous or use our real names), and so - despite the headlines - we have a tendency to be <b>more open and honest with online friends</b> than with their offline counterparts, and <b>we believe other people are being more open an honest with us too</b>.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to generate strong feelings of <b>trust</b> more rapidly online, which in turn leads to a sense that another person is <b>credible</b> source of information, which in turn leads to <b>influence</b>. \r\n\r\nIn fact, <b>we do attitude and behaviour change in the same way as offline</b>: <i>we are influenced by the people we know whom we compare ourselves with</i>, and whom we view as typical of our social identities - that sense of who we are and which group we belong to. \r\n\r\nBut because we have less information about the other people online - we have a tendency to <i>conform</i> to the attitudes and behaviours that people whom we (superficially) believe are more like us demonstrate.\r\n\r\nBut even more fascinating, we are more likely to fill in the blanks about people's attitudes based on what we think they think, often perceiving their attitudes as <i>more extremely similar</i> to ourselves than they actually are. \r\n\r\nAnd so what we have online is <b>social conformity based on a social pressure that more than likely doesn't exist or is believed to be something than it is</b>.\r\n\r\nWhat a house of cards.\r\n\r\n<b>Silencing Serendpity</b>\r\nSo what happens when you combine these tendencies with the extrordinary world wide web - an information repository so vast that it's impossible to parse it in a meaningful way? A library of information that demands filters because it's so enormous, otherwise it would be as utterly useless as a novel of words rearranged in a completely random order?\r\n\r\nHow on earth does Joe or Jane Web user decide which content to look at and what to be influenced by?\r\n\r\nWell, as a social psychologist, I'd say it's <b>social influence</b>.\r\n\r\nAnd web developers are getting pretty wise to this. You don't have to look far to see them trying to do it: first the focus of the success of a website was about getting eyeballs through developing community. More recently, it was about personalising search, and encouraging social searching services. The premise was that you'd be more likely to believe the information that was delivered to you from someone you viewed as similar, trustworthy and credible. And we already know how those form.\r\n\r\nThen came the next evolution of social searching - the phase we're currently in now: social network searching. And it's doing a phenomenal job of filtering the Web. CNN proudly announced last month that <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-01/tech/social.network.news_1_social-networking-sites-social-media-social-experience?_s=PM:TECH\">75% of its news hits come from links on social networking services</a> like Facebook and Twitter. \r\n\r\nMay I remind you that Facebook and Twitter are services that pair users with their friends.\r\n\r\nI would therefore say that what these services are doing is breaking the original ethos of Web.\r\n\r\n<b>Losing the Vision</b>\r\nBack in the day, the pioneers who settled on the frontiers believed that we would open our minds to new and amazing things because of the vast quantities of information that we would have at our finger tips. And yes, thank you <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>, thank you the medium of mindlessly surfing, but I would propose that our courses through the Web - that seem at first random - are actually <i>determined by what we want to know and what we want to hear</i>.\r\n\r\nThere are successful business models based exactly on this: amazon's recommendation engine is a case in point. it gives you exactly what you think you want based on what it is that you already read - or what people who are similar to you already read - thus providing a more than certain sale and a good feeling overall.\r\n\r\nBut this is ultimately leading to an <b>echo chamber</b>, which which we are deluded in thinking that <i>everyone else online thinks like we do, does what we do and believes what we do</i>.

But it&#8217;s the softer, meat-space side that I&#8217;m interested in, how the ubiquity of computing will transform our relationships with one another and how we perceive ourselves. I feel these are important things to consider when designing applications and services that utilise ubiquitous computing, because of the social phenomena that emerge &#8211; through traceable or untraceable means &#8211; and what it is that, through more thoughtful design that includes features of social interaction, we can learn about humanity.</p>\n<p><b>active versus passive/computers versus meat-space</b><br />\nThere is currently, in most cases, a disconnect between us and the machine.

Friendship is simplest form of connection, and a feature of offline life that social networks in particular have exploited in their designs. In fact, they&#8217;re the basis of the business models that networks like Facebook and LinkedIn run on today: they operate on idea that individuals with friends will influence friends to join, thus increasing the value of the networks for themselves and for future customers. Facebook and LinkedIn then sell those connections on to highest bidders &#8211; in Facebook&#8217;s case, Microsoft &#8211; and you and your friends become the property of very rich organisations.</p>\n<p>Now, connection with people you care about or have similar interests with is what I believe is the basis for the success of the World Wide Web. It&#8217;s the social that made it more of a phenomenon than the simple library of information it provides.</p>\n<p>Of course, this wasn&#8217;t the original intention of the creators of the Web; Tim Berners-Lee did not think about this when he developed his hyper-text protocol. He&#8217;s an engineer and he was thinking about allowing people to connect with assets and content, not to one another. And so it&#8217;s up to social scientists like myself to try to understand how this very simple innovation became the vastly important interpersonal communication tool it is today. Even more importantly, it&#8217;s up to us to understand what it means for the offline person to be friends with someone else online.</p>\n<p>Anthropologists became the first people to really look at the communities that began to develop out of the technology as academics and fans, actually, of the Grateful Dead and others started interacting with one another via the Web. To the horror of the rest of the world, reports emerged about how human behaviours &#8211; like emotional connectedness, community, hierarchy, belongingness, stereotypes (the things that aren&#8217;t immediately obvious through binary digits) &#8211; were not only possible, but thrived in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>This is a controversial contention, of course. There are proponents &#8211; of course you can have meaningful friendships online &#8211; and there are detractors &#8211; how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space?</p>\n<p>Some of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they&#8217;re already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society&#8217;s annual conference.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you&#8217;ve never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it&#8217;s possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it&#8217;s even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>&#8216;s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a &#8217;communication closness&#8217;, and yes, it&#8217;s interesting, but I don&#8217;t think it captures everything.</p>\n<p>In fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who&#8217;s giving who money? That&#8217;s one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn&#8217;t know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, &#8220;Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Why is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another&#8217;s attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.<br />\n<b><br />\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b><br />\nSo I&#8217;ve talked about how it&#8217;s difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it&#8217;s actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?</p>\n<p>Well, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn&#8217;t mention, however, was that proximity &#8211; the experience of being &#8216;together&#8217; &#8211; is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are &#8216;close&#8217; not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online. My mother, hilariously, sends me email responses to my twitter feeds and now uses words like &#8216;nom nom nom&#8217; because I write that on my twitter updates.</p>\n<p>Also, facilities like Twitter or Facebook or other social networks that are constantly updated give people a lot of information about which they can base a feeling of similarity on. Similarity online is a fascinating area. Because it&#8217;s so lean, we have to rely on interpersonal cues that we extrapolate from the communication that&#8217;s actively &#8211; proactively &#8211; distributed (check out more on this within the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Identity_model_of_Deindividuation_Effects_%28SIDE%29\"><span class=\"caps\">SIDE</span> framework</a> from Martin Lea and Russell Spears). So, Facebook or Twitter updates give people minute-to-minute detail about what people are eating, the kinds of new stories they find important, who they&#8217;re chatting with, the kinds of activities they take part in &#8211; and these help to form a basis of similarity. More likely it&#8217;s a false basis &#8211; both because it&#8217;s a constructed reality on the part of the person who&#8217;s tweeting or updating, and because we as beasts insist on filling in the gaps with confirmatory content: stuff that makes us think that other people are actually more similar to ourselves than they really are.</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a little aside &#8211; a cautionary tale, as it were &#8211; mine and others&#8217; research has shown that not only do we perceive people to be like us when they aren&#8217;t (hold similar attitudes, do similar things), but we perceive them to be more extreme than us. We make assumptions based on false perceptions (known as pluralistic ignorance) that confirm our existing biases. See <a href=\"http://profesores.ie.edu/magdalena/index.html\">Magdalena Wojcieszak</a>&#8217;s 2009 paper, &#8220;False Consensus Goes Online: Impact of Ideologically Homogeneous Online Groups on False Consensus&#8221; for more.</p>\n<p>This weird self-confirmatory loop that we find ourselves in online because we gravitate towards the people who we perceive to be like us because of what they say and do on Twitter can actually make us more extreme. So here&#8217;s a call to arms, clever future people: it&#8217;s your job to create applications that can break this, to give us <b>serendipity</b> online, to force us to look at people we think are dissimilar, and to recognise that there are other views on the internet than those that are like ours. Please.</p>\n<p>Either that, or do what I did a few weeks ago, and I followed three people who&#8217;s opinions I actively dislike on Twitter. Yes, I feel more incensed. Yes my blood pressure is a little bit higher. But I also feel a little more intelligent about the world because I&#8217;ve remembered that it&#8217;s not all about me and people who think like me.</p>\n<p><b>the cult of me me me</b><br />\nWhich leads me onto my next point. I&#8217;d like to go back to something I briefly said earlier:&nbsp; I said that our realities online are constructed. And yes, this is not a new insight. Websites for decades have been decorated just like teeenagers&#8217; bedrooms: identity is plastered everywhere, but in the most rosy and attractive way possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/%7Esturkle/\">Sherry Turkle</a> wrote extensively about this in 1995 in her book <i>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</i>. Prescient woman. However, things haven&#8217;t changed much except how many people are online. I do wonder how her observations, made a long time ago in Internet-land, have transferred into the modern day, mass media consumption of Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and other web phenomena.</p>\n<p>Case study: me. I will tweet things that make me look good. You&#8217;re not going to get the fugly, though you might get close. My <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#search?q=from%3Aaleksk%20%23PhDHell\">#phdhell</a> hashtag exposes a whole lot about what my mental state was like when I was going through what you fools are doing now. No, the real ugly stuff is preserved for my personal, secret, totally private and untraceable account that will take an injunction from twitter to get access to. That&#8217;s not an invitation.</p>\n<p>But you know, how happy and proactive and brilliant everyone is online sometimes gets to me, frankly. I think it was Morrissey who said &#8216;we hate it when our friends become successful&#8217;. It&#8217;s great to see that friends are doing well, but only hearing how awesome they are and how excellent everything is can have a negative effect on the self-confidence if things are hum-drum in your own existence, despite the fact that it&#8217;s not a realistic account of what their lives are actually like.</p>\n<p>This is a strange culture of the Cult of Me. Me me me me: you have to update or you disappear. You have to wave your arms around like a digital extrovert, or people will forget you. You have to: you&#8217;re only as good as your last tweet. And so it becomes an exercise in personal marketing: <i>I</i> am more brilliant than <i>you</i>. But really, are you? No one is that one-sided. Where does the bad stuff go if you&#8217;re constantly on show?</p>\n<p>It does seem as if people do want to know the bad stuff; I&#8217;ve heard some people say that they think the reason the British population felt wary about Gordon Brown when he came into the Prime Minister&#8217;s position after Tony Blair stepped down from the Labour leadership is because he didn&#8217;t have an archive of embarrassing gaffes &#8211; images, <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Video/Webcameron.aspx\">videos of him with marigolds on</a>, stories about him from friends from his college days &#8211; that made him more &#8220;human&#8221;. They thought he was considered two-dimensional.</p>\n<p>Ubiquitous computing applications and technologies will inevitably expose the bad side. But that is when you&#8217;re are going to start getting real issues in the public sphere about privacy, and what should and should not be shared online. After all, it&#8217;s the bad stuff that can really ruin your reputation.</p>\n<p><b>the epic importance of social capital online</b><br />\nReputation: part and parcel of trust, and one of the other important aspects of influence. Your online social capital &#8211; the interpersonal currency that wraps interpersonal trust and reputation up into a bundle and defines your value as an individual of influence over others &#8211; is the basis for much of the influential interaction in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>My social capital, for example, has increased loads since doing the virtual revolution documentary because people think that I am now connected to Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Gates, Al Gore and Stephen Fry. They think I can get them in touch with these people, that I can facilitate some kind of meeting, that I can make things happen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital\">Social capital</a> is, of course, not just about celebrity. Social capital is what makes the world go &#8216;round: it enhances social cohesion, it brings disparate groups together and it gets things done. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam\">Putnam</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone\">bemoaned</a> the demise in social capital in the latter part of the 20th century using evidence from the decline in rates of Boy and Girl Scouts, attendance in churches and other community groups and so on, suggesting that it was the media &#8211; including the Internet &#8211; that was responsible for these trends. The passive media angle was extended most recently by Clay Shirky in his latest book. But as I said in another post, I don&#8217;t actually think it was the increase in media consumption, but the increase in separate media consumption and the proliferation of content equating to the loss in precious water-cooler moments that has had the biggest effect. But that&#8217;s an aside.</p>\n<p>In fact, I&#8217;m willing to put myself on the line and say that social capital is the <b>only</b> currency in cyberspace. <a href=\"http://dmitriwilliams.com/\">Dimitri Williams</a>&#8216;s online social capital research concurs. But frankly, it&#8217;s damned difficult to capture with 1s and 0s (<a href=\"http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol11/issue2/williams.html\">though even Dmitri has tried</a>). What you do and what others say about you &#8211; including your digital footprint left behind by your online behaviours &#8211; is all you have to trade on in the online world.</p>\n<p>But the difference between social capital online versus social capital offline is that it&#8217;s possible for individuals to manipulate how much social capital they&#8217;re perceived to have &#8211; note the word perceived &#8211; and that&#8217;s one of the wonderful outcomes of the most interesting feature of the Internet experience: the flattening of hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Take Twitter, for example. I can quite happily communicate with people whom I admire. There&#8217;s no barrier to getting their attention. All I have to do is direct a message at them, and they&#8217;ll be aware of my presence.</p>\n<p>Even better, my peers who follow me will see that I am communicating with these people, and my level of apparent social capital will increase, because it will appear that I&#8217;m associated with them.</p>\n<p>But really, anyone can do that. Scratch under the surface to get to the reality: the real indication of social capital is to get them to respond back in public. To get them to @ me. And then, their followers will see that I am actually associated with them, and they&#8217;ll come and check me &#8211; and my inane wittering about constantly being late and what i ate for breakfast &#8211; out. And suddenly, my influence quotient goes up. But its still not the whole picture. I&#8217;m still an online fabrication. You&#8217;re reading a first-person perspective of me.</p>\n<p><b>the end</b><br />\nWhat happens when it&#8217;s all out there, when you don&#8217;t have to search for it. Suddenly you can&#8217;t big yourself up nearly as much as you did before. Nor can you create a false self that will win friends and influence people.</p>\n<p>I guarantee that with advances in and pervasiveness of ubiquitous computing technologies and data, you will will generate a more powerful trust&nbsp; because all your cards will be laid on the table for all to see. Parsing it is another issue.</p>\n<p>That is the power of what you are doing: you are bringing the social to the web. And for that, as a social psychologist interested in the ephemera of human behaviour, I thank you very much.</p>", :title=>"[Academic] Missing out on meat-space: Ubiquitous computing and the human experience of 'being online'", :created_at=>Fri Jul 16 12:58:49 +0100 2010, :sticky_tag_id=>nil, :body=>"I gave the after-dinner talk at the recent <a href=\"https://www.horizon.ac.uk/students/\">Horizon Doctoral Training Centre's Summer School</a> at the University of Nottingham to a roomful of extraordinarily inspirational PhD students who are doing their research in the field of Ubiquitous Computing and the Digital Economy.&nbsp; In it, I focus on what it is that computing cannot (currently?) capture about the human experience when online (accurate readings of friendship, social capital, trust, reputation and identity), but how applications like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a> are helping populate the empty spaces that binary digits are unable to represent.\r\n\r\nThis is a first stab at the synthesis of these topics based on my research and reading in this area with the aim of turning it into a chapter/chapters in a book,&nbsp; and I was pleased to receive feedback and comments from the audience.

There are proponents - of course you can have meaningful friendships online - and there are detractors - how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space? \r\n\r\nSome of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they're already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society's annual conference. \r\n\r\nI'd like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you've never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it's possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it's even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>'s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a 'communication closness', and yes, it's interesting, but I don't think it captures everything.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who's giving who money? That's one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do. \r\n\r\nI <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn't know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, \"Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat\".\r\n\r\nWhy is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another's attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.\r\n<b>\r\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b>\r\nSo I've talked about how it's difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it's actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?\r\n\r\nWell, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn't mention, however, was that proximity - the experience of being 'together' - is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are 'close' not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online. My mother, hilariously, sends me email responses to my twitter feeds and now uses words like 'nom nom nom' because I write that on my twitter updates.\r\n\r\nAlso, facilities like Twitter or Facebook or other social networks that are constantly updated give people a lot of information about which they can base a feeling of similarity on. Similarity online is a fascinating area. Because it's so lean, we have to rely on interpersonal cues that we extrapolate from the communication that's actively - proactively - distributed (check out more on this within the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Identity_model_of_Deindividuation_Effects_%28SIDE%29\">SIDE framework</a> from Martin Lea and Russell Spears). So, Facebook or Twitter updates give people minute-to-minute detail about what people are eating, the kinds of new stories they find important, who they're chatting with, the kinds of activities they take part in - and these help to form a basis of similarity. More likely it's a false basis - both because it's a constructed reality on the part of the person who's tweeting or updating, and because we as beasts insist on filling in the gaps with confirmatory content: stuff that makes us think that other people are actually more similar to ourselves than they really are.\r\n\r\nAnd here's a little aside - a cautionary tale, as it were - mine and others' research has shown that not only do we perceive people to be like us when they aren't (hold similar attitudes, do similar things), but we perceive them to be more extreme than us. We make assumptions based on false perceptions (known as pluralistic ignorance) that confirm our existing biases. See <a href=\"http://profesores.ie.edu/magdalena/index.html\">Magdalena Wojcieszak</a>'s 2009 paper, \"False Consensus Goes Online: Impact of Ideologically Homogeneous Online Groups on False Consensus\" for more.\r\n\r\nThis weird self-confirmatory loop that we find ourselves in online because we gravitate towards the people who we perceive to be like us because of what they say and do on Twitter can actually make us more extreme. So here's a call to arms, clever future people: it's your job to create applications that can break this, to give us <b>serendipity</b> online, to force us to look at people we think are dissimilar, and to recognise that there are other views on the internet than those that are like ours. Please.\r\n\r\nEither that, or do what I did a few weeks ago, and I followed three people who's opinions I actively dislike on Twitter. Yes, I feel more incensed. Yes my blood pressure is a little bit higher. But I also feel a little more intelligent about the world because I've remembered that it's not all about me and people who think like me.\r\n\r\n<b>the cult of me me me</b>\r\nWhich leads me onto my next point. I'd like to go back to something I briefly said earlier:&nbsp; I said that our realities online are constructed. And yes, this is not a new insight. Websites for decades have been decorated just like teeenagers' bedrooms: identity is plastered everywhere, but in the most rosy and attractive way possible.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/%7Esturkle/\">Sherry Turkle</a> wrote extensively about this in 1995 in her book <i>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</i>. Prescient woman. However, things haven't changed much except how many people are online. I do wonder how her observations, made a long time ago in Internet-land, have transferred into the modern day, mass media consumption of Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and other web phenomena. \r\n\r\nCase study: me. I will tweet things that make me look good. You're not going to get the fugly, though you might get close. My <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#search?q=from%3Aaleksk%20%23PhDHell\">#phdhell</a> hashtag exposes a whole lot about what my mental state was like when I was going through what you fools are doing now. No, the real ugly stuff is preserved for my personal, secret, totally private and untraceable account that will take an injunction from twitter to get access to. That's not an invitation.\r\n\r\nBut you know, how happy and proactive and brilliant everyone is online sometimes gets to me, frankly. I think it was Morrissey who said 'we hate it when our friends become successful'. It's great to see that friends are doing well, but only hearing how awesome they are and how excellent everything is can have a negative effect on the self-confidence if things are hum-drum in your own existence, despite the fact that it's not a realistic account of what their lives are actually like.\r\n\r\nThis is a strange culture of the Cult of Me. Me me me me: you have to update or you disappear. You have to wave your arms around like a digital extrovert, or people will forget you. You have to: you're only as good as your last tweet. And so it becomes an exercise in personal marketing: <i>I</i> am more brilliant than <i>you</i>. But really, are you? No one is that one-sided. Where does the bad stuff go if you're constantly on show?\r\n\r\nIt does seem as if people do want to know the bad stuff; I've heard some people say that they think the reason the British population felt wary about Gordon Brown when he came into the Prime Minister's position after Tony Blair stepped down from the Labour leadership is because he didn't have an archive of embarrassing gaffes - images, <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Video/Webcameron.aspx\">videos of him with marigolds on</a>, stories about him from friends from his college days - that made him more \"human\". They thought he was considered two-dimensional.\r\n\r\nUbiquitous computing applications and technologies will inevitably expose the bad side. But that is when you're are going to start getting real issues in the public sphere about privacy, and what should and should not be shared online. After all, it's the bad stuff that can really ruin your reputation.\r\n\r\n<b>the epic importance of social capital online</b>\r\nReputation: part and parcel of trust, and one of the other important aspects of influence. Your online social capital - the interpersonal currency that wraps interpersonal trust and reputation up into a bundle and defines your value as an individual of influence over others - is the basis for much of the influential interaction in cyberspace. \r\n\r\nMy social capital, for example, has increased loads since doing the virtual revolution documentary because people think that I am now connected to Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Gates, Al Gore and Stephen Fry. They think I can get them in touch with these people, that I can facilitate some kind of meeting, that I can make things happen.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital\">Social capital</a> is, of course, not just about celebrity. Social capital is what makes the world go 'round: it enhances social cohesion, it brings disparate groups together and it gets things done. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam\">Putnam</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone\">bemoaned</a> the demise in social capital in the latter part of the 20th century using evidence from the decline in rates of Boy and Girl Scouts, attendance in churches and other community groups and so on, suggesting that it was the media - including the Internet - that was responsible for these trends. The passive media angle was extended most recently by Clay Shirky in his latest book. But as I said in another post, I don't actually think it was the increase in media consumption, but the increase in separate media consumption and the proliferation of content equating to the loss in precious water-cooler moments that has had the biggest effect. But that's an aside. \r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm willing to put myself on the line and say that social capital is the <b>only</b> currency in cyberspace. <a href=\"http://dmitriwilliams.com/\">Dimitri Williams</a>'s online social capital research concurs. But frankly, it's damned difficult to capture with 1s and 0s (<a href=\"http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol11/issue2/williams.html\">though even Dmitri has tried</a>). What you do and what others say about you - including your digital footprint left behind by your online behaviours - is all you have to trade on in the online world.\r\n\r\nBut the difference between social capital online versus social capital offline is that it's possible for individuals to manipulate how much social capital they're perceived to have - note the word perceived - and that's one of the wonderful outcomes of the most interesting feature of the Internet experience: the flattening of hierarchy.\r\n\r\nTake Twitter, for example. I can quite happily communicate with people whom I admire. There's no barrier to getting their attention. All I have to do is direct a message at them, and they'll be aware of my presence. \r\n\r\nEven better, my peers who follow me will see that I am communicating with these people, and my level of apparent social capital will increase, because it will appear that I'm associated with them.\r\n\r\nBut really, anyone can do that. Scratch under the surface to get to the reality: the real indication of social capital is to get them to respond back in public. To get them to @ me. And then, their followers will see that I am actually associated with them, and they'll come and check me - and my inane wittering about constantly being late and what i ate for breakfast - out. And suddenly, my influence quotient goes up. But its still not the whole picture. I'm still an online fabrication. You're reading a first-person perspective of me.\r\n\r\n<b>the end</b>\r\nWhat happens when it's all out there, when you don't have to search for it. Suddenly you can't big yourself up nearly as much as you did before. Nor can you create a false self that will win friends and influence people.\r\n\r\nI guarantee that with advances in and pervasiveness of ubiquitous computing technologies and data, you will will generate a more powerful trust&nbsp; because all your cards will be laid on the table for all to see. Parsing it is another issue. \r\n\r\nThat is the power of what you are doing: you are bringing the social to the web.

Influence theories that focus on notions of interpersonal trust, source credibility and similarity are potentially contested in the new web paradigm, where identity is fluid and rapid dissemination of new ideas and disinformation from anonymous sources is made possible because of the ease with which the digital content can be reproduced and shared.

Widespread, free and open content sources like weblogs and forums produce libraries of user-generated contributions that can be accessed and repurposed by consumers, challenging models of knowledge ownership and distribution via top-down sources like newspapers, radio and television. Influence theories that focus on notions of interpersonal trust, source credibility and similarity are potentially contested in the new web paradigm, where identity is fluid and rapid dissemination of new ideas and disinformation from anonymous sources is made possible because of the ease with which the digital content can be reproduced and shared.

It aims to identify the true political, economic, social and psychological implications of this new technology. I spoke to an extraordinary cast of characters including the web pioneers, the e-entrepreneurs, and the sceptics who have seen it all before.</p>\n<p>We identified the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog1.shtml\">new power brokers in our society</a>, whose non-traditional ascents through the web have challenged hundreds of years of hierarchy. We found the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog2.shtml\">kids who took down the economic, communication and political pillars of an entire country</a> with the press of a button. We looked at the tactics extremists use to radicalise new recruits, and compared them to the methods that have proved so successful in getting a generation that had been dismissed as dispassionate involved in politics.</p>\n<p>We also looked at how the trails of information that we leave across the web are not only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog3.shtml\">redefining privacy</a>, but are creating feedback loops that may be narrowing our horizons, rather than opening our eyes to the new. And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.</p>\n<p>I started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,&#8221; Stephen Fry told me. &#8220;He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. &#8220;It seemed like a great new world,&#8221; he enthused. &#8220;It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. &#8220;It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it. Anyone who has historically held control over the distribution of information 420023 governments, media, agents 420023 is having to reposition in the face of this information tsunami.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Individuals without great wealth or bases of power and the industrial world economy can exert influence on others who find their ideas resonating with them,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;It is inherently democratising and egalitarian and promotes a greater role for the rule of reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is always dangerous, however, to be blinded by idealism. The web is undoubtedly a transformative technology on a par with the printing press, but it&#8217;s difficult to believe that it will bring the end of inequality or will eradicate international conflict. In fact, some have learned to manipulate the web&#8217;s power for their own ends.</p>\n<p>When this sits well with our personal politics, we celebrate. A <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/\">25-year-old from San Francisco</a> can create <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/haystack-good-luck-finding-that-needle/\">a piece of software</a> that opens up a channel of communication on the violent streets of post-election Iran, giving protesters the ability to transmit what is happening to the rest of the world. Teenagers in London can <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/\">organise mass protests on climate change</a>, rallying people from around the country to march on a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. But when the same techniques and tools are used to radicalise new recruits to fundamentalist causes, to attack a country&#8217;s banks and newspapers, or to promote propaganda within authoritarian states, the web becomes something to condemn.</p>\n<p>The debate becomes even more personal when you consider how our use of this overwhelmingly commercial space is transforming what privacy means in the 21st century. As we traipse across the web, our trails of personal information are captured and manipulated. We get services for free, but our actions are analysed to produce precisely targeted advertising that funds the companies behind the websites.</p>\n<p>The greatest shock to most people is that we willingly create this commercial pact when we think we&#8217;re alone. A Google search, for example, transcends the barrier between what we view as public and what we view as private. When we do a search on our computers at home, in the office or on the road, we have a misplaced sense we are transacting only with our machine. In fact, when we type a query in Google&#8217;s search box, we are divulging our intentions to a technology located across the planet, with hundreds of potential eyeballs sifting through our search terms for the perfect advertising match. Yet we still treat it like an oracle, asking it deeply personal questions and looking for answers in its computer brain.</p>\n<p>The surveillance implications for this are clear, but there are wider cultural implications when the money people behind the scenes get their rewards for feeding us exactly what we want. Amazon&#8217;s recommendation engine, Last.fm&#8217;s social music service, even news sites such as the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">Huffington Post</a>, reduce the possibility for serendipity by serving up what they think we want, channelling us into a loop of confirmation. As author <a href=\"http://rushkoff.com/\">Douglas Rushkoff</a> says: &#8220;The more like one of my kind of person I become, the less me I am, and the more I am a demographic type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Socially, this is as potentially damaging as what the extremists peddle; we are coagulating into tight-knit groups who reinforce our own beliefs. It&#8217;s a far cry from the global group hug that web proponents such as Fry or Gore had hoped it would be.</p>\n<p>In addition, the web may be fundamentally changing how we think. There is evidence that there is a generational difference between how children and adults consume information online. A team of researchers led by Professor David Nicholas, of the independent research group <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/\">Ciber</a>, at University College London, has begun a series of experiments to test whether the architecture of the web put into place by Berners-Lee is transforming the connections in our brains. A lifetime of use seems to be having a cognitive effect.</p>\n<p>Under-18s who have grown up with the web are better at multi-tasking. They also spend less time searching for information before deciding on what they view as the best answer to a question. Most intriguingly, the youngest users, born after 1993, &#8220;crowdsource&#8221; their knowledge: they look for the wisdom of their friends, networking what they know, rather than holding on to the information for themselves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/tag/phd\">My PhD research</a> looked at the social psychological implications of our interactions online. What I have come to conclude is that who we are on the web is simply a reflection of who we already are offline. We project hierarchical systems into the virtual world. We extend our interests and make them happen using the tools the web provides. We seek out things that make us feel good about ourselves. The web is a mirror, and we have to face it in confidence, warts and all.</p>\n<p>Our relationship with the web is a synergy: as it matures, so will we.

It is a position that stands in stark contrast with the approach of countries, including China, Egypt and Iran, that seek to curb access 420023 and while there was a whiff of economic self-protectionism in Clinton's words, she opened up the floor to a global discussion about the potential revolutionary power of this invention.\r\n\r\nLess than two decades after it came into being, the web is now a pawn in an international public policy debate that could create rifts between nations so deep that they lay the foundation for future wars.\r\n\r\nFor the past year, I have been <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/tag/digital%20revolution\">working</a> on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution\">Virtual Revolution</a>, a four-part documentary series for BBC2, co-produced by the Open University. It aims to identify the true political, economic, social and psychological implications of this new technology. I spoke to an extraordinary cast of characters including the web pioneers, the e-entrepreneurs, and the sceptics who have seen it all before.\r\n\r\nWe identified the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog1.shtml\">new power brokers in our society</a>, whose non-traditional ascents through the web have challenged hundreds of years of hierarchy. We found the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog2.shtml\">kids who took down the economic, communication and political pillars of an entire country</a> with the press of a button. We looked at the tactics extremists use to radicalise new recruits, and compared them to the methods that have proved so successful in getting a generation that had been dismissed as dispassionate involved in politics.\r\n\r\nWe also looked at how the trails of information that we leave across the web are not only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog3.shtml\">redefining privacy</a>, but are creating feedback loops that may be narrowing our horizons, rather than opening our eyes to the new. And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.\r\n\r\nI started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.\r\n\r\n\"Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,\" Stephen Fry told me. \"He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.\"\r\n\r\nFry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. \"It seemed like a great new world,\" he enthused. \"It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.\"\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. \"It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it. Anyone who has historically held control over the distribution of information 420023 governments, media, agents 420023 is having to reposition in the face of this information tsunami.\r\n\r\n\"Individuals without great wealth or bases of power and the industrial world economy can exert influence on others who find their ideas resonating with them,\" Gore said. \"It is inherently democratising and egalitarian and promotes a greater role for the rule of reason.\"\r\n\r\nIt is always dangerous, however, to be blinded by idealism. The web is undoubtedly a transformative technology on a par with the printing press, but it's difficult to believe that it will bring the end of inequality or will eradicate international conflict. In fact, some have learned to manipulate the web's power for their own ends.\r\n\r\nWhen this sits well with our personal politics, we celebrate. A <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/\">25-year-old from San Francisco</a> can create <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/haystack-good-luck-finding-that-needle/\">a piece of software</a> that opens up a channel of communication on the violent streets of post-election Iran, giving protesters the ability to transmit what is happening to the rest of the world. Teenagers in London can <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/\">organise mass protests on climate change</a>, rallying people from around the country to march on a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. But when the same techniques and tools are used to radicalise new recruits to fundamentalist causes, to attack a country's banks and newspapers, or to promote propaganda within authoritarian states, the web becomes something to condemn.\r\n\r\nThe debate becomes even more personal when you consider how our use of this overwhelmingly commercial space is transforming what privacy means in the 21st century. As we traipse across the web, our trails of personal information are captured and manipulated. We get services for free, but our actions are analysed to produce precisely targeted advertising that funds the companies behind the websites.\r\n\r\nThe greatest shock to most people is that we willingly create this commercial pact when we think we're alone. A Google search, for example, transcends the barrier between what we view as public and what we view as private. When we do a search on our computers at home, in the office or on the road, we have a misplaced sense we are transacting only with our machine. In fact, when we type a query in Google's search box, we are divulging our intentions to a technology located across the planet, with hundreds of potential eyeballs sifting through our search terms for the perfect advertising match. Yet we still treat it like an oracle, asking it deeply personal questions and looking for answers in its computer brain.\r\n\r\nThe surveillance implications for this are clear, but there are wider cultural implications when the money people behind the scenes get their rewards for feeding us exactly what we want. Amazon's recommendation engine, Last.fm's social music service, even news sites such as the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">Huffington Post</a>, reduce the possibility for serendipity by serving up what they think we want, channelling us into a loop of confirmation. As author <a href=\"http://rushkoff.com/\">Douglas Rushkoff</a> says: \"The more like one of my kind of person I become, the less me I am, and the more I am a demographic type.\"\r\n\r\nSocially, this is as potentially damaging as what the extremists peddle; we are coagulating into tight-knit groups who reinforce our own beliefs. It's a far cry from the global group hug that web proponents such as Fry or Gore had hoped it would be.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the web may be fundamentally changing how we think. There is evidence that there is a generational difference between how children and adults consume information online. A team of researchers led by Professor David Nicholas, of the independent research group <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/research/ciber/\">Ciber</a>, at University College London, has begun a series of experiments to test whether the architecture of the web put into place by Berners-Lee is transforming the connections in our brains. A lifetime of use seems to be having a cognitive effect.\r\n\r\nUnder-18s who have grown up with the web are better at multi-tasking. They also spend less time searching for information before deciding on what they view as the best answer to a question. Most intriguingly, the youngest users, born after 1993, \"crowdsource\" their knowledge: they look for the wisdom of their friends, networking what they know, rather than holding on to the information for themselves.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/tag/phd\">My PhD research</a> looked at the social psychological implications of our interactions online. What I have come to conclude is that who we are on the web is simply a reflection of who we already are offline. We project hierarchical systems into the virtual world. We extend our interests and make them happen using the tools the web provides. We seek out things that make us feel good about ourselves. The web is a mirror, and we have to face it in confidence, warts and all.\r\n\r\nOur relationship with the web is a synergy: as it matures, so will we. And as it draws us into its networks and its hyperlinks, we will shape them in our global image. It is the most revolutionary evolution that we as a planet have ever participated in. \"The sorts of things which the internet brings by connecting people,\" Berners-Lee said to me while we were travelling to a community centre in Abiriw, outside Accra, \"is openness and understanding of other people's ideas.\r\n\r\n\"On a good day,\" he added. \"I hope we have a lot of good days.\"\r\n\r\n<i>Read the original in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">The Observer</a></i>", :name=>"observer-democratic-but-dangerous-too-how-the-web-changed-our-wo", :updated_at=>Sun Jan 24 12:07:27 +0000 2010, :id=>135, :is_draft=>false}>]

A mobile diary application was developed which allows participants to rapidly capture how serendipity happens in their daily life and the context in which they experience serendipity for one week. Their diary entries were discussed during post-study interviews.<br/><strong>Analysis.</strong>0240An Emergent Themes Analysis was conducted to understand our data.<br/><strong>Results.</strong>0240We identified: 1) some key elements to support understanding of serendipity, 2) the influential role of context in serendipitous experiences, 3) a framework of understanding how serendipity happens and 4) the positive impacts of serendipity in people&#8217;s information research.<br/><strong>Conclusions.</strong>0240Our research suggests that a framework for classifying serendipity should consider aspects associated with the activity, the value of the information, the source of the information and the interaction between the individual and the context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A wonderful, empirical close reading of serendipity that is (crucially) <em>user-centred</em>.

Simply, unlike the capacity to learn &#8211; which can be measured &#8211; social and psychological concepts that are difficult to measure, like serendipity, are too multifaceted to be programmed in a way that can scale for the current capacity of computer processors. Services that claim to generate serendipitous outcomes may produce something that mimics coincidence, but the attribution of serendipity is inherently too complex for current digital technologies to discern.</p>\n<p><b>defining the problem</b></p>\n<p>The problem is one of definition, and how to adequately represent this: such phenomena are socially, culturally, temporally, materially defined, thus databases that seek to reduce it by collecting data points and applying heuristic algorithms would expand exponentially if they tried to document as much as necessary to accurately replicate the serendipitous effect. Common constituents shared between people do help to locate an individual within certain parameters &#8211; country, demography, religious or political orientation, IQ, etc &#8211; but proportions of the components are unique to each person. Measuring the being human thus becomes a philosophical problem rather than a technological one.</p>\n<p>As we have discovered in the previous talks on this panel, serendipity is difficult to define because it relies upon the individual&#8217;s sense-making of a &#8220;happy accident&#8221; or the unexpected confluence of worlds (trickster). The current crop of &#8220;digital serendipity solutions&#8221; produce an avatar of &#8220;serendipity&#8221; based on discovery mechanism heuristics that do not account for the various environmental and individual elements that contribute to that attribution. Certainly the results might &#8220;pass&#8221; as serendipity, and this may be the desired effect for entities who wish to invest in this area, but their solutions are neither serendipitous nor scientific because the inputs they carer for pre-suppose a self-fulfilling &#8211; and non-accidental &#8211; outcome.</p>\n<p><b>how have</b></p>\n<p>Instead, a complex concept like serendipity can be more holistically represented and understood in a way that allows for what Law (2004) describes as &#8220;messiness,&#8221; or the array of elements that are difficult to reduce or to conventionally order or organise (Jungnickel, 2010).</p>\n<p>There are methods that seek to capture the messiness of human experience, particularly in the social sciences; for example, qualitative research analytic techniques in the psychological sciences, like Grounded Theory and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, seek to understand the experience of the individual, and ethnographic work, primarily used in sociology and anthropology, explore the sense-making processes employed by groups by examining texts and objects produced by participants in social systems. Yet even these methods fall short of being able to convey the outcomes, particularly because of the agendas and ideologies imbued in the written word (Sellen &amp; Harper, 2001; Krotoski, in press) as the resulting sense-making by the researcher(s) is commonly reduced into text-based interpretations that are static.</p>\n<p><b>how to &#8220;make sense&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>An alternative method, practiced by Jungnickel and McHardy (2010) explores dynamic systems of sense-making by producing physical interpretations of data and theory, encouraging an ongoing, collaborative and reflexive understanding of the aspects of experience we are unable to measure or control.

The good news is that <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/11057400816/a-user-centred-mobile-diary-study-approach-to\">they are too</a>.\r\n\r\nHere's the talk I gave at the panel:\r\n\r\n<b>Beautiful Machines: A sense-making methodology for serendipitous discovery</b>\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive research exploring how to build digital technologies that can mimic human processes like learning and logic, but this paper takes as its starting point that the phenomenological experience of being human is not replicable in the digital environment. Simply, unlike the capacity to learn - which can be measured - social and psychological concepts that are difficult to measure, like serendipity, are too multifaceted to be programmed in a way that can scale for the current capacity of computer processors. Services that claim to generate serendipitous outcomes may produce something that mimics coincidence, but the attribution of serendipity is inherently too complex for current digital technologies to discern. \r\n\r\n<b>defining the problem</b>\r\n\r\nThe problem is one of definition, and how to adequately represent this: such phenomena are socially, culturally, temporally, materially defined, thus databases that seek to reduce it by collecting data points and applying heuristic algorithms would expand exponentially if they tried to document as much as necessary to accurately replicate the serendipitous effect. Common constituents shared between people do help to locate an individual within certain parameters - country, demography, religious or political orientation, IQ, etc - but proportions of the components are unique to each person. Measuring the being human thus becomes a philosophical problem rather than a technological one.\r\n\r\nAs we have discovered in the previous talks on this panel, serendipity is difficult to define because it relies upon the individual's sense-making of a \"happy accident\" or the unexpected confluence of worlds (trickster). The current crop of \"digital serendipity solutions\" produce an avatar of \"serendipity\" based on discovery mechanism heuristics that do not account for the various environmental and individual elements that contribute to that attribution. Certainly the results might \"pass\" as serendipity, and this may be the desired effect for entities who wish to invest in this area, but their solutions are neither serendipitous nor scientific because the inputs they carer for pre-suppose a self-fulfilling - and non-accidental - outcome.\r\n\r\n<b>how have</b>\r\n\r\nInstead, a complex concept like serendipity can be more holistically represented and understood in a way that allows for what Law (2004) describes as \"messiness,\" or the array of elements that are difficult to reduce or to conventionally order or organise (Jungnickel, 2010). \r\n\r\nThere are methods that seek to capture the messiness of human experience, particularly in the social sciences; for example, qualitative research analytic techniques in the psychological sciences, like Grounded Theory and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, seek to understand the experience of the individual, and ethnographic work, primarily used in sociology and anthropology, explore the sense-making processes employed by groups by examining texts and objects produced by participants in social systems. Yet even these methods fall short of being able to convey the outcomes, particularly because of the agendas and ideologies imbued in the written word (Sellen & Harper, 2001; Krotoski, in press) as the resulting sense-making by the researcher(s) is commonly reduced into text-based interpretations that are static. \r\n\r\n<b>how to \"make sense\"</b>\r\n\r\nAn alternative method, practiced by Jungnickel and McHardy (2010) explores dynamic systems of sense-making by producing physical interpretations of data and theory, encouraging an ongoing, collaborative and reflexive understanding of the aspects of experience we are unable to measure or control. They are creating a series of \"Enquiry Machines\" that are an assemblage of human, non-human and conceptual components aimed at, \"drawing attention to the material nature of enquiry420046 an attempt to critically examine practice420046a metaphor in action.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/15224631?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/15224631\">Enquiry Machine #1 - Making</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/katjung\">Kat Jungnickel</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\nThe function of performative methods that \"make real\" are multifold, serving the researchers' sense-making and demonstrating the viewers and users the conceptual complexity involved in the social phenomenon under consideration. The processes which Jungnickel documents in her ethnographic performative practices, including the development of Enquiry Machine No 1, \"open[s] up alternate means of interrogating [her] ideas.\" She describes the reflexivity for the researcher involved in the choice of materials, the spatial configurations and the locations of display and the \"messy, dynamic and collaboratively produced\" evolution of the meaning of the research objects (including text, video, imagery, physical object) as viewers make \"informal and serendipitous connections\" and transform the display.\r\n\r\n<b>making sense for them</b>\r\n\r\n!http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wkgIzuqJM0w/TN_BiBwPxjI/AAAAAAAAHLM/Fz3DYjKKeiU/strogatz.detailed.533.jpg!:http://www.zerohedge.com/article/welcome-machine\r\n\r\nThe sense-making by individuals towards the content is also represented in other machines that have had research and artistic agendas. The MONIAC computer was an analogue computer devised and built by a sociology graduate with an interest in economic principles as a demonstration tool for classrooms, and which became a predictive tool for governments and commercial organisations. \r\n\r\nCreated in 1949 by William Phillips in his spare time, the MONIAC is approximately 2 metres high, 1 metre wide and 1 metre deep. Its components include a series of found transparent plastic tanks and pipes affixed to a wooden board that contained different-coloured water that flowed between tanks to represent economic principles and the setting for economic parameters like tax and investment rates. It made visible the hidden inter-relationships between variables. Phillips' computer was his method for translating the language of economics into hydraulics, \"from a language he didn't understand into a language which he did.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bXBuWUQ24vU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThe computer succeeded in its objective: \"It was such a supreme visual telling of the mechanics of the Keynsian idea that I think all students felt for the first time they started to understand what the basic ideas were all about.\" Dr Brian Henry, Director of the Centre for the Centre for International Macroeconomics, Oxford University\r\n\r\n<b>making sense for her</b>\r\n\r\n!http://dbprng00ikc2j.cloudfront.net/work/image/188183/abagl8/forgiveness_machine_1.jpg!:http://www.beautifulcrap.com\r\n\r\nArtist Karen Green's series of prints of fictional machines represents another kind of sense-making different from Phillips', Jungnickel's and McHardy's: their objects explained \"objective\" principles by seeking to unpick the principles according to theory, while Green's machines represent a sense-making that is subjective and intended to represent a personal working-through of a concept. The Forgiveness Machine was developed in response to her husband's suicide and the need to process that event. \"420034The forgiveness machine was seven-feet long,420035 she says, 420034with lots of weird plastic bits and pieces. Heavy as hell.420035 The idea was that you wrote down the thing that you wanted to forgive, or to be forgiven for, and a vacuum sucked your piece of paper in one end. At the other it was shredded, and hey presto.\" When physically re-created and put on display in an art gallery, the reaction had qualities similar to the machines previously described, instilling a sense of connection with the principles on display (emotional, conceptual).\r\n\r\n<i>The machine was overwhelmed, too; it couldn't process all the requests and was eventually dismantled. \"Forgiving is never as easy as we would like,\" she says. \"Apparently quite a lot of people cried.\"</i> \r\n- <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/10/karen-green-david-foster-wallace-interview\">The Guardian, 11 April 2011</a>\r\n\r\n<b>making sense of serendipity</b>\r\n\r\nThe Serendipity Engine, a collaboration with Jungnickel, is the second in the Enquiry Machine series, and similarly seeks to render visible the multiple socio-material-technical (and I would add, psychological) processes that are invested in the attribution of serendipity. It is an \"engine\" rather than a machine because, although it has a form and a function with a purpose - to render visible the cultural, temporal and material processes in generating a serendipitous outcome - it will transform the essential properties of the input. It will irrevocably convert the ins and transform them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine. \r\n\r\n<i>It will change the nature of chance by inspiring insight in order that value is attributed to the experience.</i>\r\n\r\nThe \"engine\" will have three forms: \r\n\r\n1) Jungnickel and I will develop a physical \"core\" that is based upon the current body of research that seeks to define the socio-cultural, psychological, technological and material nature of serendipity. This will be a dynamic and interactive entity made from scrounged materials, curated to represent \"mess\".

Are they the same in terms of form and function?</p>\n<p><strong>Raging against the machine</strong></p>\n<p>A few frantic brainstormed notes that I just scribbled down say, &#8220;Machines are objects that you use to &#8216;do&#8217; something; they have an <em>objective</em>: render visible, create an output, solve a problem, demonstrate. A machine has an input and an output.&#8221; These hastily-considered parameters frame the construction of the thing: it has to have an in, where things are <em>introduced</em>, and an out, where things are <em>produced</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\">OED</a> defines a &#8220;machine&#8221; as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A material structure designed for a specific purpose, and related uses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>and</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>An apparatus constructed to perform a task or for some other purpose; also in derived senses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>In other words, a machine has a <em>purpose</em>. It has to <em>perform</em>. It has a <em>function</em>.0240It must <em>do</em> something. Will the Serendipity Engine <em>do</em>0240anything? Well, yes. <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/8637791073/the-problem-with-digital-serendipity-solutions-notes\">Kat &amp; I have agreed</a> that it has to render visible the social, cultural, temporal and material processes involved in generating a serendipitous outcome.0240</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Form and function</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>According to these definitions, it also has to have a physicality.

In fact:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A conceptual, abstract, or theoretical mechanism or device; spec. a model or mathematical abstraction of an existing or hypothetical computer. Cf. Turing Machine.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>But its constituent parts must be.</span></p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Engine=Machine?</strong></p>\n<p><span>An engine is one type of machine. The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62223?rskey=6Wdgz3&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid\">OED</a> defines it as &#8220;A machine, contraption, or mechanism.&#8221; Therefore in order to fit into the category, it must have a function, a purpose, an input and an output in order to demonstrate the concept and/or abstraction of the preceding verbal descriptor, <em>serendipity</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span>But what are the unique elements of an engine? Does an engine <em>do</em> something unique to other machines? The definitions of the word decree that an engine <em>transforms</em> something into something else:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A complicated machine with moving parts, for producing a given physical effect,0240esp. the conversion of power into motion.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>It propels things forward by converting a raw material into energy (steam, water etc), it calculates (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine\">Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine</a>), it computes (game engine). A machine can do something without transforming the essential properties of the input, like move something from A to B, but <strong>an engine is a subcategory that takes the0240ins and irrevocably converts them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>We have to make something that changes the essential nature of social experience into a serendipitous outcome.

Is the web a serendipity machine  or a tool for cultural homogenisation? Or is it, like so many things,  not nearly so black and white?</p>\n<p>This fortnight, I tackle a pet  topic: what <em>is</em> the web doing for (or against) serendipity.

We have a mutual obsession with serendipity.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, many of our conversations have glanced on the concept; some have been recorded for posterity (on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2011/may/03/tech-weekly-art-love-bin-laden\">The Guardian&#8217;s Tech Weekly podcast</a> and on social media), others have been lost in the ephemera of meatspace. And while Chris concurs with my blue-sky social scientific conceptualisation, his work as a programmer has placed pragmatic limitations on how serendipity can actually be applied in cold, hard, binary (virtual) reality.</p>\n<p>Chris&#8217; work as a research scientist/technologist has evolved into an interest in large databases and the ways they can be used to help people discover new things. Case in point, Artfinder is a service that, using a database of all of the art in museums around the world, ostensibly helps people bump up into new art that they would probably like.</p>\n<p>This precisely sums up my problem with so-called digital serendipity solutions. And so this is precisely what Chris, Kat and I talked about.</p>\n<p>In the process, we landed on two key things:</p>\n<ul><li>to maximise the experience of happy accidents, web designers should curate not-quite-right solutions and let consumers do the processing</li>\n<li>it&#8217;s possible to produce coincidence online, but it&#8217;s <em>not</em> possible to engineer serendipity because we are always too active to achieve <em>flow</em></li>\n</ul><p>Here&#8217;s more:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\n<p><em><strong><!-- more --></strong></em></p>\nHow To Produce Web-Based Happy Accidents</strong></em></p>\n<p>Serendipity is &#8220;too important a mechanism to ignore,&#8221; says Chris, but the way the web works is as a <strong>filter</strong> - designed to give a specific answer - which ignores serendipity. This is a linear approach.</p>\n<p>He sees his alternative as <strong><em>curatorial</em></strong> - designed to give an outcome in which the result is a collection of &#8220;objects&#8221;. The connections and analyses - that which ultimately produces the sagacity which in turn returns the value (to the beneficiary) of serendipity - are the consumer&#8217;s responsibility. The pathway branches.</p>\n<p><strong>A branching pathway is much more difficult to code because it doesn&#8217;t scale.</strong></p>\n<p>Chris believes that the question we must ask as consumers is how we want to discover.</p>\n<p>On this concept, our conversation turned to <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/\">Matt Jones</a>, co-founder of travel-based social networking site <a href=\"http://www.dopplr.com\">Dopplr</a> &amp; now one of the principles at London design studio <a href=\"http://berglondon.com\">Berg</a>. Matt <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/2009/02/18/exporting-the-past-into-the-future-or-the-possibility-jelly-lives-on-the-hypersurface-of-the-present/\">described my own predilection nicely</a> in a post about to maximise coincidence (note: I didn&#8217;t say serendipity) based on physical location. This tweet from his stream (in the post) sums it up nicely:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://magicalnihilism.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/twitter-_-matt-jones_-i-still-maintain-perhaps.png?w=676&amp;h=430\" align=\"middle\" height=\"291\" width=\"458\"/></p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://scraplab.net/2009/02/06/hereish-nowish/\">Hereish/Nowish/Soonish/Good Enough</a>&#8221; aren&#8217;t being built into technological solutions because there&#8217;s a fetishisation of precision. For example, we don&#8217;t get search results that seem off the mark; we discarded services that didn&#8217;t offer relevance long ago.</p>\n<p>In his post, Matt argues that the future cannot be automated, but future <em>coincidences</em> might occur because of the future intentionality Dopplr users share with people they trust.0240</p>\n<p>BUT. A <em>serendipitous</em> discovery might occur via Dopplr because the system&#8217;s accompanying &#8220;visualisations, tips,  statistics and other tools&#8221; allow you to &#8220;reflect on your past travels&#8221;. This is a bedrock upon which  sagacity might bloom. It produces the methods and materials for you to make the connections yourself, drawing on your self-knowledge.</p>\n<p>Chris wants developers to complicate their creations even more: forcing  awkward connections by juxtaposing &#8220;unrelated&#8221; (but <em>thematic</em>)  content. But this demands thoughtfulness from the perspective of the <strong>curator-developer</strong>. It means that they must blend the randomness in so people don&#8217;t think of it as error.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anti-Flow</strong></em></p>\n<p>Is the web itself the problem? We are so active as we traverse across it that we can&#8217;t experience the magnificent <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29\">flow</a></em> (<span class=\"citation book\">see <a href=\"http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4751.asp\">Csikszentmihalyi</a>&#8217;s publications)</span>, allowing our minds bimble as we do something else utterly immersive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Flow</strong> is the <a title=\"Mental state\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state\">mental state</a> of operation in which a person in  an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full  involvement, and success in the process of the activity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I experience flow most frequently when I&#8217;m running or cycling through the city streets. What is exceptionally flow-ful is that when I am utterly physically focussed on not getting killed by a taxi, a bus or a truck, my mind is able to wander and process something else. I guess this is <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/5219111468/an-incomplete-list-of-serendipity-necessities-v1\">what Steven Johnson means</a> when he says one of the ingredients in the Good Idea Recipe is to take A Creative Walk, or A Hot Bath.</p>\n<p><strong>We can&#8217;t do that online.</strong> We go online to find stuff out, to do things. Our HeadRAM is totally taken up with these tasks and cannot wander, process, make lateral connections. We are fully occupied, but not in a way that encourages us to think about or make sense of anything else.</p>\n<p>&#8212;-</p>\n<p>My big question is, <strong>do developers really <em>want</em> to create serendipity? I think the answer is no. </strong>I think they want to create discovery machines that provide solutions to consumers because that&#8217;s why consumers go to the Web.</p>\n<p>Discovery can be managed, engineered, programmed. Serendipity - occasionally the product of discovery - cannot.</p>", :title=>"Curating in the anti-Flow.

We talked about a lot of things - talks we&#8217;re giving, building materials we need, dream design projects we&#8217;d like to work on - but most importantly we decided two things:</p>\n<p>024002400240 42004202400240 0240how the Serendipity Engine fits into the Enquiry Machine series<br/>02400240 024042004202400240 0240what&#8217;s problematic about the processes the technologists are using to build their serendipity engines</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.enquirymachines.com/\">The Enquiry Machines series</a> (aka &#8220;instruments of enquiry&#8221;) seeks to render visible the processes of enquiry. As Kat describes, &#8220;by making something visible, you ask the audience to ask questions about it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Our starting point in this EM#2 is to take as a framework/starting point <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>the Web</strong>. In this research project we&#8217;re seeking to understand <em>how serendipity is currently missing from the knowledge production environment</em>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, <strong>we seek to disrupt a culture that</strong> (we feel) <strong>frames the serendipity experience as solution-driven</strong>: the &#8220;serendipity engine&#8221; that commercial digital organisations (from Google to Artfinder) are trying to create will answer questions about how to produce serendipitous answers and outcomes. The engines they will produce will be self-fulfilling because they will be embedded in the ideologies of what are considered valid and relevant &#8220;answers&#8221; and &#8220;outcomes&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Their inputs will anticipate their outputs.</strong></p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound like accidental discovery to me. Nor does it sound like sound science.</p>\n<p><strong>Furthermore, we have no idea what those inputs are, or what they  are (explicitly or implicitly) motivated by.</strong></p>\n<p>Full disclosure: this project does have an output that is defined as serendipity. This has been a matter of debate between Kat and I. But the way we have come to terms with this is that our approach will render visible the processes that lead to our defined serendipity outcome, <em>not</em> occlude them. Serendipity must be defined in order to establish the frame through  which to identify the variables that can be used to enquire about it.  The definition can necessarily include what it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><strong>The nature of the Enquiry Machines is to inquire about enquiry</strong>: the outcome is itself the question. Thus, the Serendipity Engine demands that the outcome be the realisation (or not) of serendipity.0240</p>\n<p>We are currently establishing the basic theoretical infrastructure, identifying the independent variables described in social theory (our particular specialty) that have been found to contribute to an outcome of serendipity.</p>\n<p>In future, we hope to expand this infrastructure by enlisting people from other disciplines, approaches, frameworks, cultures, perspectives (from particle physics to mathematics to baking to knitting to performance to sound to art to pathological lying) to help define the inputs that will go into the engine. The reason we will open this out is because any leaderboard of what best predicts a serendipitous outcome will very likely change with each new input. That&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>The process of enquiry is not fixed.

I am a social psychologist. I feel like I&#8217;m in a confessional. I am a social psychologist. And my bag, as it were, is social influence. Specifically, the influence that Web users exert over one another via the Web.</p>\n<p>My goodness, I can hear you say: that&#8217;s <i>exactly</i> our bread and butter! Well that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s &#8211; at least on the surface &#8211; a very good fit.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m here to tell you that the Web that you are creating &#8211; through your apps and services, your content and campaigns &#8211; is broken, and it is breaking more every time you help someone find what they&#8217;re looking for online. <b>Everything you do that gives someone what they want (or, indeed, the appearance of something they want) is undermining the original ethos of the communication technology that is revolutionising how we interact with one another</b>.</p>\n<p>Before I go in for the kill, let me back up a little bit.</p>\n<p><b>The Web is Made of Tubes</b><br />\nThe Web is an agnostic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes\">series of tubes</a> &#8211; yes tubes &#8211; that allow us to communicate.

I'm pleased it produced some thinking.\r\n\r\nThe text is below. The content is a first stab at a more robust thesis I'm working on, and so I would welcome your comments.\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather watch my keynote dance instead (I have a tendency to flap my arms around and stride up and down the stage when I give talks), the IAB has published the <a href=\"http://iabplayer.iabuk.net/default.aspx?videoID=3138\">video</a>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHello and thank you for inviting me to open this exciting event. I am a social psychologist. I feel like I'm in a confessional. I am a social psychologist. And my bag, as it were, is social influence. Specifically, the influence that Web users exert over one another via the Web.\r\n\r\nMy goodness, I can hear you say: that's <i>exactly</i> our bread and butter! Well that's great. It's - at least on the surface - a very good fit.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm here to tell you that the Web that you are creating - through your apps and services, your content and campaigns - is broken, and it is breaking more every time you help someone find what they're looking for online. <b>Everything you do that gives someone what they want (or, indeed, the appearance of something they want) is undermining the original ethos of the communication technology that is revolutionising how we interact with one another</b>.\r\n\r\nBefore I go in for the kill, let me back up a little bit.\r\n\r\n<b>The Web is Made of Tubes</b>\r\nThe Web is an agnostic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes\">series of tubes</a> - yes tubes - that allow us to communicate. It was developed, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/10/rushes-sequences-tim-bernersle.shtml\">Tim Berners-Lee said</a>, to fulfill a need: a very lazy need to get stuff from other people without needed to actually speak with them.\r\n\r\nWhat has fascinated me about this technology is how it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">holds a mirror up to us</a>: it tells us what we value, it tells us what we want, it tells us something almost essential about what it means to be human.\r\n\r\nIn my own research, I've discovered that <i>we form groups and communities in this space for the exact same reasons as we do offline</i>: to belong, to feel safe, to find out how we define ourselves according to who we deem to be similar and who we deem to be different.

I420031d like to be seen as a journalist and a researcher. I find doing research incredibly important, which is why I ended up back  in academia. Staying at the bleeding edge of technology is extremely  important to me, and being able to communicate the research. I420031m a  psychologist so I420031m interested in the effects of technology on us, so if I can somehow manage to combine the two and be, I don420031t know, an  420030academiologist420031 something like that, it would be good.</p> <p><strong><span class=\"caps\">HIW</span>: You returned to academia later on in your career, how  did you end up going back to study?</strong></p> <p>AK: In fact I presented television series420031 as early as 1999 and  finished in 2001, but I was frustrated with that medium because I felt  that it wasn420031t rich enough, it wasn420031t deep enough, I wasn420031t able to get  as involved with the subject matter as I wanted to get. Having an  academic background 420023 both my parents are doctors with PhDs, extremely  clever people 420023 it was a natural fit for me to end up back in academia,  and with the research-type background it felt quite natural. I knew that I420031d be able to get into the subject. And the fascinating human  phenomena that I found in this very clinical digital environment enabled me to further explore some of the humanity behind the machines.</p> <p><strong><span class=\"caps\">HIW</span>: You420031ve been studying the rise of social networking 420023  always a hot topic. If you could give one example of the positive  effects of this new way of interacting, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>AK: The positive side is very easy. It420031s not even just social  networking. It420031s about the opportunities that technology offers. I can  communicate with my family: my mother is currently in India, my father  is currently in Louisiana, my grandmother is in Southern California, my  aunt is in New York. I am able to communicate with them in real-time,  connect with them and maintain relationships that are experience-based  and truly the same kinds of relationships that we would have if we were  face to face [laughs] and probably better in some ways because we420031re not all in each other420031s faces all the time.</p><p><strong><span class=\"caps\">HIW</span>: And one example of any negative effects as a result of  the rise of social networking sites?</strong></p> <p>AK: In terms of the negatives, I would say that one of the thing that concerns me the most is that because these interactions are facilitated and mediated by computers 420023 and therefore we420031re in control of them 420023  they don420031t provide as much serendipity as I would hope human beings  would experience. By that I mean chance encounters, accidentally  stumbling across something. When it comes to, say, searching the web,  you420031re often very directed. Of course we can search by going down rabbit holes, but often it420031s based upon suggestions from friends and family  and it420031s based on the types of things they420031re interested in. It doesn420031t  expand your horizons nearly as much as I think that the opportunities we have face-to-face in everyday real-world encounters offer.

I420031d like to be seen as a journalist and a researcher. I find doing research incredibly important, which is why I ended up back  in academia. Staying at the bleeding edge of technology is extremely  important to me, and being able to communicate the research. I420031m a  psychologist so I420031m interested in the effects of technology on us, so if I can somehow manage to combine the two and be, I don420031t know, an  420030academiologist420031 something like that, it would be good.</p> <p><strong>HIW: You returned to academia later on in your career, how  did you end up going back to study?</strong></p> <p>AK: In fact I presented television series420031 as early as 1999 and  finished in 2001, but I was frustrated with that medium because I felt  that it wasn420031t rich enough, it wasn420031t deep enough, I wasn420031t able to get  as involved with the subject matter as I wanted to get. Having an  academic background 420023 both my parents are doctors with PhDs, extremely  clever people 420023 it was a natural fit for me to end up back in academia,  and with the research-type background it felt quite natural. I knew that I420031d be able to get into the subject. And the fascinating human  phenomena that I found in this very clinical digital environment enabled me to further explore some of the humanity behind the machines.</p> <p><strong>HIW: You420031ve been studying the rise of social networking 420023  always a hot topic. If you could give one example of the positive  effects of this new way of interacting, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>AK: The positive side is very easy. It420031s not even just social  networking. It420031s about the opportunities that technology offers. I can  communicate with my family: my mother is currently in India, my father  is currently in Louisiana, my grandmother is in Southern California, my  aunt is in New York. I am able to communicate with them in real-time,  connect with them and maintain relationships that are experience-based  and truly the same kinds of relationships that we would have if we were  face to face [laughs] and probably better in some ways because we420031re not all in each other420031s faces all the time.</p><p><strong>HIW: And one example of any negative effects as a result of  the rise of social networking sites?</strong></p> <p>AK: In terms of the negatives, I would say that one of the thing that concerns me the most is that because these interactions are facilitated and mediated by computers 420023 and therefore we420031re in control of them 420023  they don420031t provide as much serendipity as I would hope human beings  would experience. By that I mean chance encounters, accidentally  stumbling across something. When it comes to, say, searching the web,  you420031re often very directed. Of course we can search by going down rabbit holes, but often it420031s based upon suggestions from friends and family  and it420031s based on the types of things they420031re interested in. It doesn420031t  expand your horizons nearly as much as I think that the opportunities we have face-to-face in everyday real-world encounters offer. So I think  that420031s one of the negatives of social networking.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/toastkid/4910940100\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1670\" title=\"4910940100_c669e6eb6a_o\" src=\"http://www.howitworksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/4910940100_c669e6eb6a_o-248x300.jpg\" alt=\"Aleks Krotoski interview\" height=\"300\" width=\"248\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nKeep reading <a href=\"http://www.howitworksdaily.com/interview-2/aleks-krotoski-interview/\">here</a>.", :name=>"how-it-works-interview-with-me-plus-1984-images-published", :updated_at=>Fri Oct 08 13:31:34 +0100 2010, :id=>189, :is_draft=>false}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>I gave the after-dinner talk at the recent <a href=\"https://www.horizon.ac.uk/students/\">Horizon Doctoral Training Centre&#8217;s Summer School</a> at the University of Nottingham to a roomful of extraordinarily inspirational PhD students who are doing their research in the field of Ubiquitous Computing and the Digital Economy.&nbsp; In it, I focus on what it is that computing cannot (currently?) capture about the human experience when online (accurate readings of friendship, social capital, trust, reputation and identity), but how applications like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a> are helping populate the empty spaces that binary digits are unable to represent.</p>\n<p>This is a first stab at the synthesis of these topics based on my research and reading in this area with the aim of turning it into a chapter/chapters in a book,&nbsp; and I was pleased to receive feedback and comments from the audience. For example, is it possible to quantify social capital in some way and then use that as the basis of a game to influence attitudes and behaviours? When I re-posed this question on Twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Matt Locke </a>at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Channel 4 Education</a> (a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/jul/15/develop-games-awards-2010\">publishing hero</a> that has an award-winning stable of games for change) was adamant that, &#8220;games may create social capital, but it&#8217;s not a game in itself&#8230; It&#8217;s dangerous to think of social capital as an asset that can be measured or created&#8230; social capital is a story, not data.&#8221; I&#8217;d love your take on it too.</p>\n<p><!-- fold --></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hello and thank you very much for the warm invitation. When I found out I would be speaking with people who&nbsp; studied and designed ubiquitous computing, I must admit that I had a moment of panic. After all, you people are from the future, like the place inhabited by replicants and mechs and billboards that sense what you want and give it to you. That freaks me out. Frankly, you freak me out.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to retreat into a topic that I know something about and hopefully this will be of interest &#8211; and entertainment perhaps &#8211; to you, the people of the future, of what we were thinking about computers and digital technologies at the beginning of the 21st century. It was a time that was just beginning to grapple with the Internet &#8211; the most powerful communication tool known to civilization &#8211; and what it was that this tool taught us about ourselves as we left a wave of information about ourselves across the virtual ether.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a social psychologist, so I believe it is important to recognise what it is that can be understood through the data we leave behind in our daily lives &#8211; the digital footprint generated by our movements through virtual space, as it were. But I&#8217;m interested in the soft as well as the hard stuff that we can understand through our online activities. For me, the current volume of data available from our online activities is like finding the greatest treasure chest on the planet: finally &#8211; a phenomenal trove of human activity in natural settings that we can use to test theories about human behaviour and create new ones! In a natural environment! With real human responses! And no one acting differently because they feel they&#8217;re being watched by a lady in a white coat! Quick! Scrape everything, before the human subjects ethics committees realise!</p>\n<p>We know that our behaviours are captured online, and that these are used to create a digital identity that can be sold for corporate gain. The example of how Google pays for itself &#8211; through intel gleaned by slurping up our intentions &#8211; is a case in point. But it&#8217;s the softer, meat-space side that I&#8217;m interested in, how the ubiquity of computing will transform our relationships with one another and how we perceive ourselves. I feel these are important things to consider when designing applications and services that utilise ubiquitous computing, because of the social phenomena that emerge &#8211; through traceable or untraceable means &#8211; and what it is that, through more thoughtful design that includes features of social interaction, we can learn about humanity.</p>\n<p><b>active versus passive/computers versus meat-space</b><br />\nThere is currently, in most cases, a disconnect between us and the machine. Even in the case of Google, the best data capturing agent out there, we must be active in producing the information that they can use to generate our online identity. Their databases are full of our proactive behaviour, not our passive lives.</p>\n<p>So here we have a conflict between the digital space and the meat-space. I&#8217;d like to take a look at two of the things to think about when it comes to the bits that it&#8217;s more difficult to currently capture with digital technologies and when using the tech that&#8217;s coming close: the role of closeness, and how the feedback loop of constant updates is creating what I like to call a cult of me.</p>\n<p><b>the good old gooeyness of different types of friendship</b><br />\nFirst, let&#8217;s examine the basis of our social interactions: friendship. Friendship is simplest form of connection, and a feature of offline life that social networks in particular have exploited in their designs. In fact, they&#8217;re the basis of the business models that networks like Facebook and LinkedIn run on today: they operate on idea that individuals with friends will influence friends to join, thus increasing the value of the networks for themselves and for future customers. Facebook and LinkedIn then sell those connections on to highest bidders &#8211; in Facebook&#8217;s case, Microsoft &#8211; and you and your friends become the property of very rich organisations.</p>\n<p>Now, connection with people you care about or have similar interests with is what I believe is the basis for the success of the World Wide Web. It&#8217;s the social that made it more of a phenomenon than the simple library of information it provides.</p>\n<p>Of course, this wasn&#8217;t the original intention of the creators of the Web; Tim Berners-Lee did not think about this when he developed his hyper-text protocol. He&#8217;s an engineer and he was thinking about allowing people to connect with assets and content, not to one another. And so it&#8217;s up to social scientists like myself to try to understand how this very simple innovation became the vastly important interpersonal communication tool it is today. Even more importantly, it&#8217;s up to us to understand what it means for the offline person to be friends with someone else online.</p>\n<p>Anthropologists became the first people to really look at the communities that began to develop out of the technology as academics and fans, actually, of the Grateful Dead and others started interacting with one another via the Web. To the horror of the rest of the world, reports emerged about how human behaviours &#8211; like emotional connectedness, community, hierarchy, belongingness, stereotypes (the things that aren&#8217;t immediately obvious through binary digits) &#8211; were not only possible, but thrived in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>This is a controversial contention, of course. There are proponents &#8211; of course you can have meaningful friendships online &#8211; and there are detractors &#8211; how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space?</p>\n<p>Some of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they&#8217;re already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society&#8217;s annual conference.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you&#8217;ve never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it&#8217;s possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it&#8217;s even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>&#8216;s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a &#8217;communication closness&#8217;, and yes, it&#8217;s interesting, but I don&#8217;t think it captures everything.</p>\n<p>In fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who&#8217;s giving who money? That&#8217;s one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn&#8217;t know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, &#8220;Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Why is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another&#8217;s attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.<br />\n<b><br />\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b><br />\nSo I&#8217;ve talked about how it&#8217;s difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it&#8217;s actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?</p>\n<p>Well, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn&#8217;t mention, however, was that proximity &#8211; the experience of being &#8216;together&#8217; &#8211; is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are &#8216;close&#8217; not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online. My mother, hilariously, sends me email responses to my twitter feeds and now uses words like &#8216;nom nom nom&#8217; because I write that on my twitter updates.</p>\n<p>Also, facilities like Twitter or Facebook or other social networks that are constantly updated give people a lot of information about which they can base a feeling of similarity on. Similarity online is a fascinating area. Because it&#8217;s so lean, we have to rely on interpersonal cues that we extrapolate from the communication that&#8217;s actively &#8211; proactively &#8211; distributed (check out more on this within the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Identity_model_of_Deindividuation_Effects_%28SIDE%29\"><span class=\"caps\">SIDE</span> framework</a> from Martin Lea and Russell Spears). So, Facebook or Twitter updates give people minute-to-minute detail about what people are eating, the kinds of new stories they find important, who they&#8217;re chatting with, the kinds of activities they take part in &#8211; and these help to form a basis of similarity. More likely it&#8217;s a false basis &#8211; both because it&#8217;s a constructed reality on the part of the person who&#8217;s tweeting or updating, and because we as beasts insist on filling in the gaps with confirmatory content: stuff that makes us think that other people are actually more similar to ourselves than they really are.</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a little aside &#8211; a cautionary tale, as it were &#8211; mine and others&#8217; research has shown that not only do we perceive people to be like us when they aren&#8217;t (hold similar attitudes, do similar things), but we perceive them to be more extreme than us. We make assumptions based on false perceptions (known as pluralistic ignorance) that confirm our existing biases. See <a href=\"http://profesores.ie.edu/magdalena/index.html\">Magdalena Wojcieszak</a>&#8217;s 2009 paper, &#8220;False Consensus Goes Online: Impact of Ideologically Homogeneous Online Groups on False Consensus&#8221; for more.</p>\n<p>This weird self-confirmatory loop that we find ourselves in online because we gravitate towards the people who we perceive to be like us because of what they say and do on Twitter can actually make us more extreme. So here&#8217;s a call to arms, clever future people: it&#8217;s your job to create applications that can break this, to give us <b>serendipity</b> online, to force us to look at people we think are dissimilar, and to recognise that there are other views on the internet than those that are like ours. Please.</p>\n<p>Either that, or do what I did a few weeks ago, and I followed three people who&#8217;s opinions I actively dislike on Twitter. Yes, I feel more incensed. Yes my blood pressure is a little bit higher. But I also feel a little more intelligent about the world because I&#8217;ve remembered that it&#8217;s not all about me and people who think like me.</p>\n<p><b>the cult of me me me</b><br />\nWhich leads me onto my next point. I&#8217;d like to go back to something I briefly said earlier:&nbsp; I said that our realities online are constructed. And yes, this is not a new insight. Websites for decades have been decorated just like teeenagers&#8217; bedrooms: identity is plastered everywhere, but in the most rosy and attractive way possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/%7Esturkle/\">Sherry Turkle</a> wrote extensively about this in 1995 in her book <i>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</i>. Prescient woman. However, things haven&#8217;t changed much except how many people are online. I do wonder how her observations, made a long time ago in Internet-land, have transferred into the modern day, mass media consumption of Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and other web phenomena.</p>\n<p>Case study: me. I will tweet things that make me look good. You&#8217;re not going to get the fugly, though you might get close. My <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#search?q=from%3Aaleksk%20%23PhDHell\">#phdhell</a> hashtag exposes a whole lot about what my mental state was like when I was going through what you fools are doing now. No, the real ugly stuff is preserved for my personal, secret, totally private and untraceable account that will take an injunction from twitter to get access to. That&#8217;s not an invitation.</p>\n<p>But you know, how happy and proactive and brilliant everyone is online sometimes gets to me, frankly. I think it was Morrissey who said &#8216;we hate it when our friends become successful&#8217;. It&#8217;s great to see that friends are doing well, but only hearing how awesome they are and how excellent everything is can have a negative effect on the self-confidence if things are hum-drum in your own existence, despite the fact that it&#8217;s not a realistic account of what their lives are actually like.</p>\n<p>This is a strange culture of the Cult of Me. Me me me me: you have to update or you disappear. You have to wave your arms around like a digital extrovert, or people will forget you. You have to: you&#8217;re only as good as your last tweet. And so it becomes an exercise in personal marketing: <i>I</i> am more brilliant than <i>you</i>. But really, are you? No one is that one-sided. Where does the bad stuff go if you&#8217;re constantly on show?</p>\n<p>It does seem as if people do want to know the bad stuff; I&#8217;ve heard some people say that they think the reason the British population felt wary about Gordon Brown when he came into the Prime Minister&#8217;s position after Tony Blair stepped down from the Labour leadership is because he didn&#8217;t have an archive of embarrassing gaffes &#8211; images, <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Video/Webcameron.aspx\">videos of him with marigolds on</a>, stories about him from friends from his college days &#8211; that made him more &#8220;human&#8221;. They thought he was considered two-dimensional.</p>\n<p>Ubiquitous computing applications and technologies will inevitably expose the bad side. But that is when you&#8217;re are going to start getting real issues in the public sphere about privacy, and what should and should not be shared online. After all, it&#8217;s the bad stuff that can really ruin your reputation.</p>\n<p><b>the epic importance of social capital online</b><br />\nReputation: part and parcel of trust, and one of the other important aspects of influence. Your online social capital &#8211; the interpersonal currency that wraps interpersonal trust and reputation up into a bundle and defines your value as an individual of influence over others &#8211; is the basis for much of the influential interaction in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>My social capital, for example, has increased loads since doing the virtual revolution documentary because people think that I am now connected to Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Gates, Al Gore and Stephen Fry. They think I can get them in touch with these people, that I can facilitate some kind of meeting, that I can make things happen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital\">Social capital</a> is, of course, not just about celebrity. Social capital is what makes the world go &#8216;round: it enhances social cohesion, it brings disparate groups together and it gets things done. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam\">Putnam</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone\">bemoaned</a> the demise in social capital in the latter part of the 20th century using evidence from the decline in rates of Boy and Girl Scouts, attendance in churches and other community groups and so on, suggesting that it was the media &#8211; including the Internet &#8211; that was responsible for these trends. The passive media angle was extended most recently by Clay Shirky in his latest book. But as I said in another post, I don&#8217;t actually think it was the increase in media consumption, but the increase in separate media consumption and the proliferation of content equating to the loss in precious water-cooler moments that has had the biggest effect. But that&#8217;s an aside.</p>\n<p>In fact, I&#8217;m willing to put myself on the line and say that social capital is the <b>only</b> currency in cyberspace. <a href=\"http://dmitriwilliams.com/\">Dimitri Williams</a>&#8216;s online social capital research concurs. But frankly, it&#8217;s damned difficult to capture with 1s and 0s (<a href=\"http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol11/issue2/williams.html\">though even Dmitri has tried</a>). What you do and what others say about you &#8211; including your digital footprint left behind by your online behaviours &#8211; is all you have to trade on in the online world.</p>\n<p>But the difference between social capital online versus social capital offline is that it&#8217;s possible for individuals to manipulate how much social capital they&#8217;re perceived to have &#8211; note the word perceived &#8211; and that&#8217;s one of the wonderful outcomes of the most interesting feature of the Internet experience: the flattening of hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Take Twitter, for example. I can quite happily communicate with people whom I admire. There&#8217;s no barrier to getting their attention. All I have to do is direct a message at them, and they&#8217;ll be aware of my presence.</p>\n<p>Even better, my peers who follow me will see that I am communicating with these people, and my level of apparent social capital will increase, because it will appear that I&#8217;m associated with them.</p>\n<p>But really, anyone can do that. Scratch under the surface to get to the reality: the real indication of social capital is to get them to respond back in public. To get them to @ me. And then, their followers will see that I am actually associated with them, and they&#8217;ll come and check me &#8211; and my inane wittering about constantly being late and what i ate for breakfast &#8211; out. And suddenly, my influence quotient goes up. But its still not the whole picture. I&#8217;m still an online fabrication. You&#8217;re reading a first-person perspective of me.</p>\n<p><b>the end</b><br />\nWhat happens when it&#8217;s all out there, when you don&#8217;t have to search for it. Suddenly you can&#8217;t big yourself up nearly as much as you did before.

For example, is it possible to quantify social capital in some way and then use that as the basis of a game to influence attitudes and behaviours? When I re-posed this question on Twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Matt Locke </a>at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Channel 4 Education</a> (a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/jul/15/develop-games-awards-2010\">publishing hero</a> that has an award-winning stable of games for change) was adamant that, \"games may create social capital, but it's not a game in itself... It's dangerous to think of social capital as an asset that can be measured or created... social capital is a story, not data.\" I'd love your take on it too.\r\n\r\n<!-- fold -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHello and thank you very much for the warm invitation. When I found out I would be speaking with people who&nbsp; studied and designed ubiquitous computing, I must admit that I had a moment of panic. After all, you people are from the future, like the place inhabited by replicants and mechs and billboards that sense what you want and give it to you. That freaks me out. Frankly, you freak me out.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to retreat into a topic that I know something about and hopefully this will be of interest - and entertainment perhaps - to you, the people of the future, of what we were thinking about computers and digital technologies at the beginning of the 21st century. It was a time that was just beginning to grapple with the Internet - the most powerful communication tool known to civilization - and what it was that this tool taught us about ourselves as we left a wave of information about ourselves across the virtual ether.\r\n\r\nI'm a social psychologist, so I believe it is important to recognise what it is that can be understood through the data we leave behind in our daily lives - the digital footprint generated by our movements through virtual space, as it were. But I'm interested in the soft as well as the hard stuff that we can understand through our online activities. For me, the current volume of data available from our online activities is like finding the greatest treasure chest on the planet: finally - a phenomenal trove of human activity in natural settings that we can use to test theories about human behaviour and create new ones! In a natural environment! With real human responses! And no one acting differently because they feel they're being watched by a lady in a white coat! Quick! Scrape everything, before the human subjects ethics committees realise!\r\n\r\nWe know that our behaviours are captured online, and that these are used to create a digital identity that can be sold for corporate gain. The example of how Google pays for itself - through intel gleaned by slurping up our intentions - is a case in point. But it's the softer, meat-space side that I'm interested in, how the ubiquity of computing will transform our relationships with one another and how we perceive ourselves. I feel these are important things to consider when designing applications and services that utilise ubiquitous computing, because of the social phenomena that emerge - through traceable or untraceable means - and what it is that, through more thoughtful design that includes features of social interaction, we can learn about humanity.\r\n\r\n<b>active versus passive/computers versus meat-space</b>\r\nThere is currently, in most cases, a disconnect between us and the machine. Even in the case of Google, the best data capturing agent out there, we must be active in producing the information that they can use to generate our online identity. Their databases are full of our proactive behaviour, not our passive lives.\r\n\r\nSo here we have a conflict between the digital space and the meat-space. I'd like to take a look at two of the things to think about when it comes to the bits that it's more difficult to currently capture with digital technologies and when using the tech that's coming close: the role of closeness, and how the feedback loop of constant updates is creating what I like to call a cult of me.\r\n\r\n<b>the good old gooeyness of different types of friendship</b>\r\nFirst, let's examine the basis of our social interactions: friendship. Friendship is simplest form of connection, and a feature of offline life that social networks in particular have exploited in their designs. In fact, they're the basis of the business models that networks like Facebook and LinkedIn run on today: they operate on idea that individuals with friends will influence friends to join, thus increasing the value of the networks for themselves and for future customers. Facebook and LinkedIn then sell those connections on to highest bidders - in Facebook's case, Microsoft - and you and your friends become the property of very rich organisations.\r\n\r\nNow, connection with people you care about or have similar interests with is what I believe is the basis for the success of the World Wide Web. It's the social that made it more of a phenomenon than the simple library of information it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, this wasn't the original intention of the creators of the Web; Tim Berners-Lee did not think about this when he developed his hyper-text protocol. He's an engineer and he was thinking about allowing people to connect with assets and content, not to one another. And so it's up to social scientists like myself to try to understand how this very simple innovation became the vastly important interpersonal communication tool it is today. Even more importantly, it's up to us to understand what it means for the offline person to be friends with someone else online.\r\n\r\nAnthropologists became the first people to really look at the communities that began to develop out of the technology as academics and fans, actually, of the Grateful Dead and others started interacting with one another via the Web. To the horror of the rest of the world, reports emerged about how human behaviours - like emotional connectedness, community, hierarchy, belongingness, stereotypes (the things that aren't immediately obvious through binary digits) - were not only possible, but thrived in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nThis is a controversial contention, of course. There are proponents - of course you can have meaningful friendships online - and there are detractors - how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space? \r\n\r\nSome of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they're already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society's annual conference. \r\n\r\nI'd like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you've never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it's possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it's even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>'s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a 'communication closness', and yes, it's interesting, but I don't think it captures everything.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who's giving who money? That's one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do. \r\n\r\nI <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn't know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, \"Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat\".\r\n\r\nWhy is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another's attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.\r\n<b>\r\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b>\r\nSo I've talked about how it's difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it's actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?\r\n\r\nWell, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn't mention, however, was that proximity - the experience of being 'together' - is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are 'close' not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online. My mother, hilariously, sends me email responses to my twitter feeds and now uses words like 'nom nom nom' because I write that on my twitter updates.\r\n\r\nAlso, facilities like Twitter or Facebook or other social networks that are constantly updated give people a lot of information about which they can base a feeling of similarity on. Similarity online is a fascinating area. Because it's so lean, we have to rely on interpersonal cues that we extrapolate from the communication that's actively - proactively - distributed (check out more on this within the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Identity_model_of_Deindividuation_Effects_%28SIDE%29\">SIDE framework</a> from Martin Lea and Russell Spears). So, Facebook or Twitter updates give people minute-to-minute detail about what people are eating, the kinds of new stories they find important, who they're chatting with, the kinds of activities they take part in - and these help to form a basis of similarity. More likely it's a false basis - both because it's a constructed reality on the part of the person who's tweeting or updating, and because we as beasts insist on filling in the gaps with confirmatory content: stuff that makes us think that other people are actually more similar to ourselves than they really are.\r\n\r\nAnd here's a little aside - a cautionary tale, as it were - mine and others' research has shown that not only do we perceive people to be like us when they aren't (hold similar attitudes, do similar things), but we perceive them to be more extreme than us. We make assumptions based on false perceptions (known as pluralistic ignorance) that confirm our existing biases. See <a href=\"http://profesores.ie.edu/magdalena/index.html\">Magdalena Wojcieszak</a>'s 2009 paper, \"False Consensus Goes Online: Impact of Ideologically Homogeneous Online Groups on False Consensus\" for more.\r\n\r\nThis weird self-confirmatory loop that we find ourselves in online because we gravitate towards the people who we perceive to be like us because of what they say and do on Twitter can actually make us more extreme. So here's a call to arms, clever future people: it's your job to create applications that can break this, to give us <b>serendipity</b> online, to force us to look at people we think are dissimilar, and to recognise that there are other views on the internet than those that are like ours. Please.\r\n\r\nEither that, or do what I did a few weeks ago, and I followed three people who's opinions I actively dislike on Twitter. Yes, I feel more incensed. Yes my blood pressure is a little bit higher. But I also feel a little more intelligent about the world because I've remembered that it's not all about me and people who think like me.\r\n\r\n<b>the cult of me me me</b>\r\nWhich leads me onto my next point. I'd like to go back to something I briefly said earlier:&nbsp; I said that our realities online are constructed. And yes, this is not a new insight. Websites for decades have been decorated just like teeenagers' bedrooms: identity is plastered everywhere, but in the most rosy and attractive way possible.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/%7Esturkle/\">Sherry Turkle</a> wrote extensively about this in 1995 in her book <i>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</i>. Prescient woman. However, things haven't changed much except how many people are online. I do wonder how her observations, made a long time ago in Internet-land, have transferred into the modern day, mass media consumption of Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and other web phenomena. \r\n\r\nCase study: me. I will tweet things that make me look good. You're not going to get the fugly, though you might get close. My <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#search?q=from%3Aaleksk%20%23PhDHell\">#phdhell</a> hashtag exposes a whole lot about what my mental state was like when I was going through what you fools are doing now. No, the real ugly stuff is preserved for my personal, secret, totally private and untraceable account that will take an injunction from twitter to get access to. That's not an invitation.\r\n\r\nBut you know, how happy and proactive and brilliant everyone is online sometimes gets to me, frankly. I think it was Morrissey who said 'we hate it when our friends become successful'. It's great to see that friends are doing well, but only hearing how awesome they are and how excellent everything is can have a negative effect on the self-confidence if things are hum-drum in your own existence, despite the fact that it's not a realistic account of what their lives are actually like.\r\n\r\nThis is a strange culture of the Cult of Me. Me me me me: you have to update or you disappear. You have to wave your arms around like a digital extrovert, or people will forget you. You have to: you're only as good as your last tweet. And so it becomes an exercise in personal marketing: <i>I</i> am more brilliant than <i>you</i>. But really, are you? No one is that one-sided. Where does the bad stuff go if you're constantly on show?\r\n\r\nIt does seem as if people do want to know the bad stuff; I've heard some people say that they think the reason the British population felt wary about Gordon Brown when he came into the Prime Minister's position after Tony Blair stepped down from the Labour leadership is because he didn't have an archive of embarrassing gaffes - images, <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Video/Webcameron.aspx\">videos of him with marigolds on</a>, stories about him from friends from his college days - that made him more \"human\". They thought he was considered two-dimensional.\r\n\r\nUbiquitous computing applications and technologies will inevitably expose the bad side. But that is when you're are going to start getting real issues in the public sphere about privacy, and what should and should not be shared online. After all, it's the bad stuff that can really ruin your reputation.\r\n\r\n<b>the epic importance of social capital online</b>\r\nReputation: part and parcel of trust, and one of the other important aspects of influence. Your online social capital - the interpersonal currency that wraps interpersonal trust and reputation up into a bundle and defines your value as an individual of influence over others - is the basis for much of the influential interaction in cyberspace. \r\n\r\nMy social capital, for example, has increased loads since doing the virtual revolution documentary because people think that I am now connected to Tim Berners-Lee, Bill Gates, Al Gore and Stephen Fry. They think I can get them in touch with these people, that I can facilitate some kind of meeting, that I can make things happen.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital\">Social capital</a> is, of course, not just about celebrity. Social capital is what makes the world go 'round: it enhances social cohesion, it brings disparate groups together and it gets things done. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam\">Putnam</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone\">bemoaned</a> the demise in social capital in the latter part of the 20th century using evidence from the decline in rates of Boy and Girl Scouts, attendance in churches and other community groups and so on, suggesting that it was the media - including the Internet - that was responsible for these trends. The passive media angle was extended most recently by Clay Shirky in his latest book. But as I said in another post, I don't actually think it was the increase in media consumption, but the increase in separate media consumption and the proliferation of content equating to the loss in precious water-cooler moments that has had the biggest effect. But that's an aside. \r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm willing to put myself on the line and say that social capital is the <b>only</b> currency in cyberspace. <a href=\"http://dmitriwilliams.com/\">Dimitri Williams</a>'s online social capital research concurs. But frankly, it's damned difficult to capture with 1s and 0s (<a href=\"http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol11/issue2/williams.html\">though even Dmitri has tried</a>). What you do and what others say about you - including your digital footprint left behind by your online behaviours - is all you have to trade on in the online world.\r\n\r\nBut the difference between social capital online versus social capital offline is that it's possible for individuals to manipulate how much social capital they're perceived to have - note the word perceived - and that's one of the wonderful outcomes of the most interesting feature of the Internet experience: the flattening of hierarchy.\r\n\r\nTake Twitter, for example. I can quite happily communicate with people whom I admire. There's no barrier to getting their attention. All I have to do is direct a message at them, and they'll be aware of my presence. \r\n\r\nEven better, my peers who follow me will see that I am communicating with these people, and my level of apparent social capital will increase, because it will appear that I'm associated with them.\r\n\r\nBut really, anyone can do that. Scratch under the surface to get to the reality: the real indication of social capital is to get them to respond back in public. To get them to @ me. And then, their followers will see that I am actually associated with them, and they'll come and check me - and my inane wittering about constantly being late and what i ate for breakfast - out. And suddenly, my influence quotient goes up. But its still not the whole picture. I'm still an online fabrication. You're reading a first-person perspective of me.\r\n\r\n<b>the end</b>\r\nWhat happens when it's all out there, when you don't have to search for it. Suddenly you can't big yourself up nearly as much as you did before. Nor can you create a false self that will win friends and influence people.\r\n\r\nI guarantee that with advances in and pervasiveness of ubiquitous computing technologies and data, you will will generate a more powerful trust&nbsp; because all your cards will be laid on the table for all to see. Parsing it is another issue. \r\n\r\nThat is the power of what you are doing: you are bringing the social to the web.

Last night, I suggested that he had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_the_Kool-Aid\">drunk too much virtual Kool-Aid</a> (although I admitted that I am also prone to taking a few sips), and that he ignores some of the what I believe are the pragmatic shortcomings of the digital sphere (which I am currently researching): it encourages people to consume information that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbalkanization\">confirms existing biases</a>; it has the potential to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide\">exclude those who don&#8217;t understand or wish to use it</a>; it reduces serendipity; it has the potential to generate cognitive overload/burnout; it encourages a &#8220;cult of me&#8221;. The closest we got to addressing any of these points last night was to talk about <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ditto+head\">dittoheads</a>, or people whose reference for new information becomes narrower and narrower as they selectively consume what content they&#8217;ll pay attention to. This term has historically been used in other contexts, but we felt it could also be applied to people who consume a narrow amount of self-confirmatory content online.</p>\n<p>I do believe that interactivity is generally better than passivity, subscribing to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees,_Baron_Rees_of_Ludlow\">Martin Rees</a>&#8217; comment during his final <a href=\"http://j.mp/b42AHY\">Reith Lecture</a>, that, &#8220;if you compare the Internet with television, it&#8217;s more interactive, and that&#8217;s a good thing&#8221;. It is a hugely effective tool. But I also recognise that what Clay uses to argue his case are examples of people who would probably be otherwise motivated to do something given the tools at their disposals and the circumstances they find themselves in. What about all those other people with the same tools and in the same circumstances who don&#8217;t really feel the need? To create <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a> or <a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/\">LOLcats</a> (to use the examples Clay sites in his book), people need to be <i>motivated</i> and <i>able</i>. They need to have the <i>drive</i> and the <i>desire</i>. In addition, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_planned_behavior\">Theory of Planned Behaviour</a> (Ajzen, 1985) proposes that they need to have a <i>positive attitude</i>, and the <i>subjective norms</i>, <i>outcome expectations</i> and <i>behavioural self-efficacy</i> are favourable. And that&#8217;s just one social psychological approach amongst many (see also Perez and Mugny&#8217;s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=V6IezhVY0HoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=conflict-elaboration+theory&amp;ots=bPS0OvtrHY&amp;sig=3hS3PxkzYDaZJLMTLEhxQCJIvJ8#v=onepage&amp;q=conflict-elaboration%20theory&amp;f=false\">Conflict-Elaboration Theory</a>) that describes why people might do things. New technologies make it <i>possible</i> to do amazing (and not-so-amazing) things, but that doesn&#8217;t&nbsp; mean they <i>will</i> happen.</p>\n<p>I also don&#8217;t agree with the underlying message in the book that linear television sapped our motivation to do things and made us less likely to connect. TV allowed us to interact socially around common assets: that&#8217;s why TV advertising exists. As <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ianbetteridge\">@ianbetteridge</a> said on Twitter, &#8220;the idea that tech &#8216;until now&#8217; encouraged u to be passive consumers is an incredibly myopic view of technology&#8230;TV inspires other work &#8211; fanfic, water-cooler and family talk&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The thing I believe diluted the social experiences that&nbsp; historically surrounded media consumption was the sheer proliferation of assets &#8211; the hundreds of TV channels, the sheer volume of different types of media, TVs in every room. Interactions around major media events &#8211; the release of a blockbuster film or a new Harry Potter novel, a big game or a festival, or even coverage of national and international disasters &#8211; inspired a sense of belonging because people gathered around them as they do now. But they <i>are</i> distinct from interactions to these things now in two major ways: time and volume. Pre-Web, if we weren&#8217;t all watching the TV or the event in the same physical space, we would have waited until we ran into friends at the water cooler the day after to talk about, or we were limited to one or a few people over a telephone. Now, because of online tools, we are able share and receive instant, real-time feedback to something with a lot of people. That doesn&#8217;t dilute the importance of either experience; in fact, some might argue that the instantaneousness of digital social interaction has its downsides (shorter attention spans, dumbing down, playing to the crowd). But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s cause to cry revolution, either.</p>\n<p>One of the most thoughtful reviews of Clay&#8217;s book comes from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/27/cognitive-surplus-clay-shirky-book-review\">Tom Chatfield in The Observer</a> (Where else? I read it because it confirms my own biases). Tom sums up with this insightful line,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To accuse Shirky of preaching a panacea, though, is to misunderstand the simplest fact about the emerging technological and social landscape he describes: that it represents not so much a replacement of existing systems as a restoration of many far older and more intimate kinds of human relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fair enough. The Web&#8217;s greatest power is the opportunity to connect with other people, serving our social needs in a way that contemporary society may not facilitate. But to give it too much emphasis is to dissolve our human agency in favour of the machine, and to imbue this agnostic communication tool with far more magic than it deserves.</p>", :title=>"[Media] Cognitive surplus, the soma of television and being on Newsnight with Clay Shirky", :created_at=>Wed Jun 30 15:24:15 +0100 2010, :sticky_tag_id=>nil, :body=>"For the next week, you can catch my appearance on <a href=\"http://bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8776218.stm\">last night's BBC's current affairs programme Newsnight</a> with author <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/\">Clay Shirky</a>, debating the social implications of new technology.

This term has historically been used in other contexts, but we felt it could also be applied to people who consume a narrow amount of self-confirmatory content online.\r\n\r\nI do believe that interactivity is generally better than passivity, subscribing to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees,_Baron_Rees_of_Ludlow\">Martin Rees</a>' comment during his final <a href=\"http://j.mp/b42AHY\">Reith Lecture</a>, that, \"if you compare the Internet with television, it's more interactive, and that's a good thing\". It is a hugely effective tool. But I also recognise that what Clay uses to argue his case are examples of people who would probably be otherwise motivated to do something given the tools at their disposals and the circumstances they find themselves in. What about all those other people with the same tools and in the same circumstances who don't really feel the need? To create <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a> or <a href=\"http://icanhascheezburger.com/\">LOLcats</a> (to use the examples Clay sites in his book), people need to be <i>motivated</i> and <i>able</i>. They need to have the <i>drive</i> and the <i>desire</i>. In addition, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_planned_behavior\">Theory of Planned Behaviour</a> (Ajzen, 1985) proposes that they need to have a <i>positive attitude</i>, and the <i>subjective norms</i>, <i>outcome expectations</i> and <i>behavioural self-efficacy</i> are favourable. And that's just one social psychological approach amongst many (see also Perez and Mugny's <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=V6IezhVY0HoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=conflict-elaboration+theory&amp;ots=bPS0OvtrHY&amp;sig=3hS3PxkzYDaZJLMTLEhxQCJIvJ8#v=onepage&amp;q=conflict-elaboration%20theory&amp;f=false\">Conflict-Elaboration Theory</a>) that describes why people might do things. New technologies make it <i>possible</i> to do amazing (and not-so-amazing) things, but that doesn't&nbsp; mean they <i>will</i> happen.\r\n\r\nI also don't agree with the underlying message in the book that linear television sapped our motivation to do things and made us less likely to connect. TV allowed us to interact socially around common assets: that's why TV advertising exists. As <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ianbetteridge\">@ianbetteridge</a> said on Twitter, \"the idea that tech 'until now' encouraged u to be passive consumers is an incredibly myopic view of technology...TV inspires other work - fanfic, water-cooler and family talk\". \r\n\r\nThe thing I believe diluted the social experiences that&nbsp; historically surrounded media consumption was the sheer proliferation of assets - the hundreds of TV channels, the sheer volume of different types of media, TVs in every room. Interactions around major media events - the release of a blockbuster film or a new Harry Potter novel, a big game or a festival, or even coverage of national and international disasters - inspired a sense of belonging because people gathered around them as they do now. But they <i>are</i> distinct from interactions to these things now in two major ways: time and volume. Pre-Web, if we weren't all watching the TV or the event in the same physical space, we would have waited until we ran into friends at the water cooler the day after to talk about, or we were limited to one or a few people over a telephone. Now, because of online tools, we are able share and receive instant, real-time feedback to something with a lot of people. That doesn't dilute the importance of either experience; in fact, some might argue that the instantaneousness of digital social interaction has its downsides (shorter attention spans, dumbing down, playing to the crowd). But I don't think it's cause to cry revolution, either.\r\n\r\nOne of the most thoughtful reviews of Clay's book comes from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/27/cognitive-surplus-clay-shirky-book-review\">Tom Chatfield in The Observer</a> (Where else? I read it because it confirms my own biases). Tom sums up with this insightful line,\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nTo accuse Shirky of preaching a panacea, though, is to misunderstand the simplest fact about the emerging technological and social landscape he describes: that it represents not so much a replacement of existing systems as a restoration of many far older and more intimate kinds of human relations.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFair enough. The Web's greatest power is the opportunity to connect with other people, serving our social needs in a way that contemporary society may not facilitate. But to give it too much emphasis is to dissolve our human agency in favour of the machine, and to imbue this agnostic communication tool with far more magic than it deserves.", :name=>"media-cognitive-surplus-the-soma-of-television-and-being-on-news", :updated_at=>Thu Dec 09 04:49:37 +0000 2010, :id=>177, :is_draft=>false}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><b>Overview</b><br />\nThe Internet is a communication medium that challenges traditional theories of social influence.

It aims to identify the true political, economic, social and psychological implications of this new technology. I spoke to an extraordinary cast of characters including the web pioneers, the e-entrepreneurs, and the sceptics who have seen it all before.</p>\n<p>We identified the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog1.shtml\">new power brokers in our society</a>, whose non-traditional ascents through the web have challenged hundreds of years of hierarchy. We found the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog2.shtml\">kids who took down the economic, communication and political pillars of an entire country</a> with the press of a button. We looked at the tactics extremists use to radicalise new recruits, and compared them to the methods that have proved so successful in getting a generation that had been dismissed as dispassionate involved in politics.</p>\n<p>We also looked at how the trails of information that we leave across the web are not only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog3.shtml\">redefining privacy</a>, but are creating feedback loops that may be narrowing our horizons, rather than opening our eyes to the new. And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.</p>\n<p>I started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,&#8221; Stephen Fry told me. &#8220;He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. &#8220;It seemed like a great new world,&#8221; he enthused. &#8220;It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history.

It is a position that stands in stark contrast with the approach of countries, including China, Egypt and Iran, that seek to curb access 420023 and while there was a whiff of economic self-protectionism in Clinton's words, she opened up the floor to a global discussion about the potential revolutionary power of this invention.\r\n\r\nLess than two decades after it came into being, the web is now a pawn in an international public policy debate that could create rifts between nations so deep that they lay the foundation for future wars.\r\n\r\nFor the past year, I have been <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/tag/digital%20revolution\">working</a> on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution\">Virtual Revolution</a>, a four-part documentary series for BBC2, co-produced by the Open University. It aims to identify the true political, economic, social and psychological implications of this new technology. I spoke to an extraordinary cast of characters including the web pioneers, the e-entrepreneurs, and the sceptics who have seen it all before.\r\n\r\nWe identified the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog1.shtml\">new power brokers in our society</a>, whose non-traditional ascents through the web have challenged hundreds of years of hierarchy. We found the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog2.shtml\">kids who took down the economic, communication and political pillars of an entire country</a> with the press of a button. We looked at the tactics extremists use to radicalise new recruits, and compared them to the methods that have proved so successful in getting a generation that had been dismissed as dispassionate involved in politics.\r\n\r\nWe also looked at how the trails of information that we leave across the web are not only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog3.shtml\">redefining privacy</a>, but are creating feedback loops that may be narrowing our horizons, rather than opening our eyes to the new. And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.\r\n\r\nI started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.\r\n\r\n\"Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,\" Stephen Fry told me. \"He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.\"\r\n\r\nFry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. \"It seemed like a great new world,\" he enthused. \"It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.\"\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. \"It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it. Anyone who has historically held control over the distribution of information 420023 governments, media, agents 420023 is having to reposition in the face of this information tsunami.\r\n\r\n\"Individuals without great wealth or bases of power and the industrial world economy can exert influence on others who find their ideas resonating with them,\" Gore said. \"It is inherently democratising and egalitarian and promotes a greater role for the rule of reason.\"\r\n\r\nIt is always dangerous, however, to be blinded by idealism.

Built by impresario Richard D&#8217;Oyly Carte, the hotel opened on 6 August 1889 and was the first in the Savoy group of hotels and restaurants owned by Carte&#8217;s family for over a century. The hotel is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. It has been called &#8220;London&#8217;s most famous hotel&#8221; and remains one of London&#8217;s most prestigious and opulent hotels, with 263 rooms and panoramic views of the River Thames across Savoy Place and the Victoria Embankment, part of the Thames Embankment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If it was open, I could go and enjoy, &#8220;formal afternoon tea with choral performances at Christmas time including soloists.&#8221; Next year?</p>\n<p><b>Dean Street Town House for an amaretto</b><br />\nSounds lovely.

He completed the Orangery in 1761. Built of brick and coated in durable stucco, it is the largest classical style building in the Gardens.</p>\n<p>As its name suggests, the Orangery was designed as a hothouse to grow citrus plants but the low levels of light made it unsuitable for this purpose. In 1841, Kew&#8217;s Director Sir William Hooker shifted the building420031s ailing orange trees to Kensington Palace and installed large glazed doors at either end of the Orangery to improve its effectiveness. Thereafter he used the building to house plants too big for other glasshouses.</p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p>The building is now an airy and elegant eaterie capable of seating 180 visitors at any one time for lunches and afternoon teas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>&#8220;The Tree Top walk at Kew is lovely.

I have my own long list of favourite places to visit when I'm not on the clock in the capital, but, for fear of London-complacency, and thanks to the overwhelming success of the <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/lifestream-twittersource-places-to-visit-in-whitley-bay-tyneside\">Twittersource Whitley Bay experiment</a>, I thought I'd reach out and discover a few new things. I asked the Twitterverse for their 140-character suggestions for their favourite things to do in London, and here are a few of the choice suggestions (eating, drinking and general sightseeing) that came back:\r\n\r\n<b>Serpentine Gallery & coffee</b>\r\nSmack in the middle of Hyde Park, the <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegallery.org/\">Serpentine</a> always has excellent exhibitions.

It's free!\r\n\r\n<b>St. James's Park</b>\r\nI love wandering around this park; it decompresses me between office-to-soho if I'm working in Victoria. I wrote some of my <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/tag/phd\">PhD thesis</a> under a tree in it too.\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/st_james_park/\">official website</a>, three royal palaces skirt the park, including Wesminster (aka Houses of Parliament), St. James's Palace (see it in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/11/rushes-sequences-general-views-1.shtml\">this set of rushes</a> from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution\">Digital Revolution</a>) and Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\nAnd if you've got the hunger whilst worrying the pigeons, stop in at <a href=\"http://www.innthepark.com/index.asp\">Inn the Park</a>, one of my favourite restaurants in the capital.\r\n\r\n<b>Strand Savoy Hotel for tea</b>\r\n<i>(<a href=\"http://twitter.com/jeremyet\">jeremyet</a> says it's still shut for refurbishment)</i>\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Hotel\">Wikipedia</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe Savoy Hotel is a five-star hotel located on the Strand, in the City of Westminster in central London. Built by impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte, the hotel opened on 6 August 1889 and was the first in the Savoy group of hotels and restaurants owned by Carte's family for over a century. The hotel is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. It has been called \"London's most famous hotel\" and remains one of London's most prestigious and opulent hotels, with 263 rooms and panoramic views of the River Thames across Savoy Place and the Victoria Embankment, part of the Thames Embankment.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf it was open, I could go and enjoy, \"formal afternoon tea with choral performances at Christmas time including soloists.\" Next year?\r\n\r\n<b>Dean Street Town House for an amaretto</b>\r\nSounds lovely.

He completed the Orangery in 1761. Built of brick and coated in durable stucco, it is the largest classical style building in the Gardens.\r\n\r\nAs its name suggests, the Orangery was designed as a hothouse to grow citrus plants but the low levels of light made it unsuitable for this purpose. In 1841, Kew's Director Sir William Hooker shifted the building420031s ailing orange trees to Kensington Palace and installed large glazed doors at either end of the Orangery to improve its effectiveness. Thereafter he used the building to house plants too big for other glasshouses.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe building is now an airy and elegant eaterie capable of seating 180 visitors at any one time for lunches and afternoon teas.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>\"The Tree Top walk at Kew is lovely.

During the late 17th century the Castle fell into decay until Elizabeth Seymour and her husband Hugh Smithson, later to become the first Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, took up the challenge and turned it into a family residence of &#8220;gothick&#8221; style with the help of architects such as Robert Adam and the landscape designer, Capability Brown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it&#8217;s in the stunning town of Alnwick, which you can find out more about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnwick\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>BedeWorld</b><br />\n&#8220;Wayne&#8217;s World for 7th Century monks&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>From the official website:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The extraordinary life of the Venerable Bede (AD 673-735) created a rich legacy that is celebrated today at Bede&#8217;s World, Jarrow, where Bede lived and worked 1300 years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who on earth is this Venerable Bede?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bede was born in AD 673 on the lands of the monastery.

The town's market is held in its shadow every Tuesday, and its narrow streets are a magnet for shoppers. \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nHexham is surrounded by some of the most beautiful countryside you could wish to see.

The town has a pleasant mix of old stone and newer brick-built properties.  Although technically a town with a proposal a year or so back to install a town mayor (defeated) everyone still tends to call it a village and it has a village feel about it.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nRothbury has had a turbulent and bloody history.  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Coquet Valley was a pillaging ground for bands of Reivers who attacked and burned the town with terrifying frequency.  Near the town's impressive All Saints' Parish Church stands the doorway and site of the seventeenth century Three Half Moons Inn, where the Earl of Derwentwater stayed with his followers in 1715 prior to marching into a heavy defeat in battle, at Preston.\r\n\r\nLord Armstrong's Home (Cragside, now in the ownership of the National Trust) was the first house in the world to be lit by hydro electricity.

Unfortunately, I420031ve come to believe that was a huge mistake. That420031s not based on ideas, but on data. As I look at the real world of musicians and artists, I see that it&#8217;s not working. We&#8217;re not finding these legions of new middle class musicians making it without the studio systems; we420031re seeing very tiny token number of people who can get a little bit of publicity and then are never heard from again. It&#8217;s just not good enough.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s something that420031s a little hard to understand but it&#8217;s an important concept: what happens to today&#8217;s musician and journalists doesn&#8217;t end there. If it were just that, we could come up with some new institution or social arrangement to keep them from starving, and to allow them to reproduce and such things. But instead it will eventually affect everybody. Consider the advice that&#8217;s sometimes given to musicians &#8211; give away your music and sell the t-shirt. But the problem with that is of course it won&#8217;t be many years at all before there are extremely cheap robots that can make a t-shirt of any design you can find on the Internet. And the value of that custom t-shirt goes to zero, just like the value of music you rip off the Internet and burn on a CD. That principle generalises. Whatever you do that&#8217;s not given away on the Internet can be done by some robot if you go far enough in the future. The special part can be given away on the Internet.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re faced with a stark decision: we give people a way to live off their brains in the future &#8211; to earn dignity, to not have to constantly sing for their supper &#8211; some kind of intellectual property rights, some way to have a bit of breathing room to grow, or we have to accept that our problem is socialism, that we420031re trying to shut down personal reinvention and self-determinism and want to create a system where people will be universally supported by some institution. I personally support the former.</p>\n<p>I call the alternative Digital Maoism because, unlike other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\">Marxists</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism\">Maoists</a> had this real distaste for people who were earning from their brains, or from their hearts and they worshipped the peasant, the person who&#8217;s really toiling.  Every time we tell someone to give away the music and sell the t-shirt, we&#8217;re saying, 420034Don&#8217;t make your living in this more elevated way. Instead, reverse this technological progress as far as social progress in terms of ways to make a living, and choose a more physical way to make a living.420035 We&#8217;re sending them own to peasanthood, very much like the Maoists have.</p>\n<p><b>You sound like a digital utopian that&#8217;s experienced the past 20 years of the web and has grown cynical. What was it specifically &#8211; the data &#8211; that helped to transform your thoughts from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism\">libertarian</a> ideal to what you&#8217;ve termed Digital Maoism.</b><br />\nIt&#8217;s not libertarian because libertarians believe in money and commerce. That&#8217;s the thing, the people who call themselves libertarians online are not at all. They&#8217;re really some variation of Maoist or anarchist, but they&#8217;re certainly not libertarian because they&#8217;re not disavowing money as a means to make a living. Libertarianism is a false term for the movement that describes itself as that in the digital world. I didn&#8217;t realise this until I looked at the data, and the data is a lot of musicians who are doing really badly, and journalists who are doing really badly, and you can&#8217;t dismiss that data. You can&#8217;t just think, 420034OK, we&#8217;re 17 years into the web, let&#8217;s wait another 17 years.420035 It&#8217;s long enough to say we&#8217;ve performed an experiment. It was a worthy experiment, there&#8217;s no shame in having a hypothesis that doesn&#8217;t turn out well, but there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of shame that should accrue if you ignore data about how you&#8217;re hypothesis turned out because you just don&#8217;t wish to see that data. And at some point, we just have to acknowledge what it is that we&#8217;re seeing.</p>\n<p><b>So what is the solution?</b><br />\nOf course, that&#8217;s always harder. Criticism is always easier than constructive solutions. In <i>You Are Not A Gadget</i> I propose five different approaches to a solution. The one that I am the most hopeful about of those five is to return to <a href=\"http://www.almaden.ibm.com/almaden/npuc97/1996/tnelson.htm\">the very first vision of the web</a>, the first fresh version of how the web should be suggested a universal micropayment system: there&#8217;d be only one copy of something from a logical point of view; as far as you&#8217;re concerned, there&#8217;s only one copy of a creative thing, just like there&#8217;s only one copy of a YouTube video or something on the Apple store, although it may be implemented that there are other copies waiting to be downloaded faster. For practical purposes, there&#8217;s only one copy of a creative thing, and you pay a half penny every time you access it. There420031s one universal system so you don&#8217;t need to keep a separate username or password every time you visit a place where there may be content.</p>\n<p>What we&#8217;re doing right now with things like the iPad and the Kindle and Xbox Live is we&#8217;re creating these empires that each have their own accounts. People can only accommodate a small number of these, for practical reasons, so we&#8217;re creating this big studio system where everyone will have to go through one of these eight biggies, or three biggies, however many there are going to be. I&#8217;d much rather see a world of open access. In that world of open access, something remarkable would happen. Every once and a while, when you make some quirky comment on a blog or news story or you upload a video clip, instead of just a moment of fame for your pseudonym, you&#8217;ll get fifty bucks, or a thousand bucks. The very first time that happens, you&#8217;ll realise that you&#8217;re a full-class citizen. You have the potential to make money from the system. Once you hit that point, you&#8217;ll realise there&#8217;s a social contract here. And then maybe you&#8217;ll stop illegally downloading content for the same reason you don&#8217;t break into houses or cars even though you could, because it&#8217;s part of a system that&#8217;s better for everybody.</p>\n<p><b>I can see that people would try to game that system, like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party\">50 cent bloggers</a>, or <a href=\"http://valleywag.gawker.com/339271/denton-to-pay-bloggers-based-on-traffic\">Gawker</a>, which offers its bloggers money for putting successful content online. Wouldn&#8217;t that create a lowest common denominator? People seeking to earn back based on what they think would be a hit?</b><br />\nI don&#8217;t doubt that would happen, but let me point you to a number of empirical examples.</p>\n<p>Money does help. People often ask me the question, &#8220;we&#8217;re drowning in information, there&#8217;s so much of it, what can you do?&#8221; The usual geeky answer is to build an intelligent software thing that will only give you the information you need. The problem is that artificial intelligence doesn&#8217;t really exist. We don&#8217;t know what &#8216;meaning&#8217; is from a technical point of view, we don&#8217;t know how the brain thinks from a technical point of view, and so we can&#8217;t make the software. So instead we make a pseudo filter that uses keywords to pretend to understand you, and so you make yourself a moron in order to make the software look good. It&#8217;s ridiculous. What should happen instead is there should be a micro-investment to enter the system. There should be tiny amount of postage on email: that would shut down spam immediately.</p>\n<p>The idea of free an open access sounds good at first, but the reason it&#8217;s not good is twofold. One, having everything freely accessible to everyone else actually just creates this mediocre mush. The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there&#8217;s a single numeric average that actually matters. But if it&#8217;s a design or something that matters, that&#8217;s just done by committee, and that&#8217;s crap. What you really want is encapsulation. You want people who are able to introspect and groups who are able to get their ducks in a row and test results and think thoughts before they share, or if you&#8217;re in the evolutionary process and are thinking deep though about life on earth, you want punctuated equilibrium. This could be approached from may different ways.</p>\n<p>Total flat openness of everything to everything is actually not as good as encapsulated, punctuated openness, which is still just as open, but actually allows more complex and subtle differences to come out.</p>\n<p><b>My interest is looking at the social phenomenon of the web. You talk about this open system is difficult to parse because you ultimately end in mediocrity. But what happens in cyberspace is you develop <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/marshall/www/papers/CyberBalkans.pdf\">cyberbalkanisation</a> (pdf).</b><br />\nThat&#8217;s the same process. A hypothesis I420031ve been working on is that human beings, like many other species, are bimodal creatures: we can either function as individuals or we can function as members of a pack. This is not uncommon in the animal world. There&#8217;s a switch inside us, deep in our spirit, that you can turn one way or the other. I&#8217;m sure it was adaptive in some past environment in which it was reinforced. However, in the context of civilisation, where we&#8217;re trying to be decent to one another, it&#8217;s almost always the case that our worst behaviour comes out when we&#8217;re switched to the mob setting. The problem with a lot of software designs is that they switch us to that setting.</p>\n<p>What happens when you have a global mush is that people lose their identity, they become pseudonyms, they have no investment and no consequence in what they do. Whenever that situation exists, there&#8217;s a sequence I find to be in common, whether it&#8217;s a Jihadi chat site, or a chat site about beach balls or anything, is that in initially people aren&#8217;t sure what the pack is, and there&#8217;s a feeling out thing. Somebody tries to ridicule something else, and other people who want to play it safe join in so that they&#8217;re not the target. And gradually, the pack forms and you can tell a pack is formed by two things: an internal enemy, and an external enemy. The internal enemy is the low person on the totem pole, who is dumped on, who gets ridiculed. And then there&#8217;s the external enemy, the &#8216;other&#8217;. And that&#8217;s where the balkanization happens, which is extremely severe. What we have online is a total lack of communication across those boundaries. In the us, we&#8217;re practically recreating the civil war over this. It&#8217;s extraordinary. But this is exactly the inevitable consequence of matching the human spirit as it really exists, our true biology, with this open mush environment.</p>\n<p>When democracy functions well, or when markets function well, what happens is that the meanness in human spirit, the biological flaws in our spirit, are precisely countered by structures. I view democracy as the countering mirror image of biology. It&#8217;s the thing that compensates for us as we really are, to allow us to act better than we otherwise would. That&#8217;s the thing that the internet hasn&#8217;t done.</p>\n<p>Young idealists always confuse anarchy and democracy. So democracy is biologically realistic and anarchy is not. That&#8217;s the difference.</p>\n<p><b>You bring up pack mentality &#8211; we see this in playgrounds, we see this in other environments when it&#8217;s not the web.</b><br />\nThat&#8217;s because it comes from the people, not from the machine.</p>\n<p><b>What you&#8217;re suggesting then is that we have an apolitical system, an apolitical platform. But you present a compelling idea that the software designers are psychologically manipulating us, through the very way they&#8217;re designing the systems. They&#8217;re engaging us, they&#8217;re using us in may ways in order to facilitate their particular application. Do you think they&#8217;re aware of this?</b><br />\nNo, absolutely not. I&#8217;m not suggesting a conspiracy. I want to empahsise that I420031m not talking about some remote &#8216;other&#8217;. These are my friends. I&#8217;m around the people I420031m talking about every day, constantly. If there were a conspiracy, i would surely know about it by now. I would have started it probably. It&#8217;s not a conspiracy; what it is instead is religion.</p>\n<p>What I propose is that there is a certain confluence of a set of ideas which give a new strategy for the denial of death and aging which was invented by <a href=\"http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/\">Alan Turing</a> just before his suicide as he was being tortured to death by the UK government with female hormones. Turing came up with this proposal for person-machine equivalence. I think he was in the process of dying from merely being human, from merely being a sexual creature. I think he imagined this more pristine, platonic technical form of life. That idea resonated with later generations of technologists who, unlike Turing, tended to have an Asberger-y personality. This is where the nerdy, geeky quality of computer stuff comes in. Mild Asbergers is much more common in males than females, and tends to be more common in qualitative intelligence. The whole feeling of that kind of cognition is to be a little bit separated from sexuality and social stuff. Turing offered this blueprint, where you can imagine that people and machines aren&#8217;t all that different. One stream of technical culture took that approach to heart and eventually formulated a replica of traditional religions with a technical terminology: instead of the rapture, we have the singularity. All of the aspects of priesthood of weirdo fundamentalists are represented.<br />\n<b><br />\nCan you describe the concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">singularity</a>.</b><br />\nThe singularity is when all of the computers get so smart that they take over, and they&#8217;re so capacious that they scoop up the contents of our brains and we get to live forever. And this is not some fringe thought. This is a very central movement in the technological world. Next door to Google there&#8217;s a whole <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\">Singularity University</a> where you can go and get a degree in this particular theology. It&#8217;s well attended, it&#8217;s expensive.</p>\n<p>Given that there&#8217;s this theological drive to equate people and computers, more and more designs have that quality. One of the reasons that the Web 2.0 stuff suppresses individuals and brings out this mob identity is that it allows us to pretend that the machine is becoming intelligent and doing work, and we do that by suppressing the people. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page\">Larry Page</a> can say that the Google server&#8217;s coming alive, but that&#8217;s only possible because we don&#8217;t see the people behind the curtain.<br />\n<b><br />\nWhat would you say are the unique elements, the unique aspects of human beings that cannot be replicated by computers?</b><br />\nI don&#8217;t have any certainty about this, but what I suggest is we should be naturalists when it comes to reality at large. We shouldn&#8217;t assume supernatural forces in nature because it makes it harder to understand nature, which is a beautiful thing to do.</p>\n<p>However, I think we should take a supernatural attitude towards ourselves. The reason why is that if you don&#8217;t, if you&#8217;re internally a naturalist and think of yourself as a form of machine, you write crap software. You have to respect people in a special way to write good software. Err on the side of assuming human specialness. I can give many arguments also that have to do with human consciousness and the nature of time, and those arguments are interesting, but fundamentally the argument is pragmatic: if you think that there&#8217;s something specially supernatual about people, and there isn&#8217;t, what harm is done. It&#8217;s a little bit like <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/\">Pascal&#8217;s Bargain</a> for the technological age.</p>\n<p>However, if people are special and we treat ourselves as if we aren420031t, and we act like machines, we act like members of a mob for the service of supposed machine intelligence, well, we&#8217;ll have failed to enjoy or perhaps even have destroyed something beautiful. There&#8217;s really no risk in treating oneself supernaturally, and really every risk in not doing so. <br />\n<b><br />\nAs humanity, we are able to create and appreciate culture. One of your arguments is that culture is disintegrating. Are mash-ups and other repurposings not evidence of a sophisticated repackaging of culture?</b><br />\nThere&#8217;s a fuzzy line here. Obviously, all of culture depends on something similar to a mash up, but the difference between real culture and fake culture is do you internalise the thing before you mash it. Does it become part of you. Is there some way your meaning, your person, your spirit, your understanding has actually touched this thing. Or is it just cut and paste, digital, a touch of novelty for a moment to get some attention, no connection to the people. What I compare it to is what missionaries do to native cultures. Missionaries preserved a little bit of Aztec music, but we don&#8217;t really understand what it was really like because they destroyed the context, they just snapped out a little tiny piece of it, the bit that could be used to colour the European form. And that is what we do when we do a cheap mashup.</p>\n<p>A deep mashup is when you internalise the thing, and when it comes out it is both a reference to this thing and at the same time it&#8217;s a piece of you, an expression. Culture involves some work, some risk, some exploration, some surprise. Cheap mashups are entirely the opposite of deep culture. But reference and reuse are obviously the core of culture too.</p>\n<p><b>So, is your criticism that, as a group, as a social entity, we don&#8217;t have those cornerstones that would have encouraged us to gather around a cultural artefact? Aren&#8217;t mashups, blogposts and other online content those cornerstones that help define our common phenomena from the web?</b><br />\nNo, because the gathering is the monopoly. Maoists would say we want to flatten the hierarchy so let&#8217;s make everyone a peasant, and we&#8217;ll send you to the field. In fact, they were putting up their own hierarchy, which was the communist party in which there is obviously a strong sense of hierarchy. In the same way, there&#8217;s a natural hierarchy of this mashable ritual stuff that&#8217;s going on with these fake companies that don&#8217;t even make money &#8211; like Facebook and Twitter. The owner of the server becomes the Lord, or Mao. There are two kinds of servers that accrue power: one is the advertising exchange, which is a monopoly, and that&#8217;s Google. The other is the hedge fund computer which does exactly the same thing and siphons money out of the system at a very abstract level to the general detriment of everyone. In each case, the hierarchy is how meta you can be: to what degree can you be at the highest level, which corresponds nicely to how close you can be to the central server. That&#8217;s the new hierarchy, and that&#8217;s what everyone wants to climb.</p>\n<p><b>Information has a hierarchy online as well, for example, Wikipedia. Even <a href=\"http://blog.jimmywales.com/\">Jimmy Wales</a> accepts that there must be hierarchy online. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianna_Huffington\">Arianna Huffington</a> accepts that hierarchy and elitism must exist in these spaces in order for information to be parsed and accessible to human beings. Even these new web elite &#8211; even these people who helped to bring forward the web 2.0 phenomenon are themselves engaging actively in a hierarchical structure. </b><br />\nI used to blog for Arianna. I was a top blogger, i was always right at the top, always featured every day I did it. But I stopped when I realised what it was doing to me. It was making me mean and into someone who played to the crowd too much.</p>\n<p>Encapsulation is crucial, and that implies hierarchy. The point of a hierarchy is not that we should impose a hierarchy, but that there should be a crucial fairness to it. There should be a sense of access and a sense of equity to achieve a point in the hierarchy. In other words, it should be a meritocracy. That&#8217;s the crucial thing here. Google is not a meritocracy. It&#8217;s a first arrival advantage. That can be seen very easily when you look at <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bing.com\">Bing</a> results and people just have their brand loyalty and they can&#8217;t tell [which one is better]. The reason they can&#8217;t tell is because artificial intelligence doesn&#8217;t exist. With the hedge funds, it&#8217;s a very similar thing: it&#8217;s elitist access. The math isn&#8217;t all that hard. It&#8217;s access and position that gives you a hedge fund computer that lets you pull the money out of the system.</p>\n<p>What we should seek is not an end to hierarchy, but a fair, meritorious end to hierarchy. I think <a href=\"http://ted.hyperland.com/\">Ted Nelson</a>&#8217;s original idea would give us that.</p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;d like to expand this a little more given that you&#8217;ve been in this space for such a long time. The web emerged from a particular ideology given the group of people who colonised it in the first place: they came primarily from the San Francisco area. Idealists. Arguably, there&#8217;s an approach to the web that has come from that space. What would a web look like that came from somewhere like China or South America? Is it fundamentally what would have happened?</b><br />\nThe original idea for the web that ted nelson conceived would be, I believe, vastly superior to what we did instead. The reason Ted&#8217;s idea didn&#8217;t happen is partially because Ted wasn&#8217;t a good manager, he wasn&#8217;t the best person to bring it forward. Equally there were two classes of ideologues at the time who shouted him down. Neither of whom i have any sympathy for. One were the campus Maoists. There was tremendous leftist sensibility at this time, in the 70s and 80s. I remember situations where there would be people who&#8217;d shout Ted down at his talks, not letting him get a word in, only because he was interested in this idea of money in the digital world. He was the actual libertarian, and these anti-money people are not at all.</p>\n<p>The other group were the people were those who thought that everyone wanted to be a massive couch potato and no one could offer anything. This was the most common thing you heard: nobody wants to be creative. Unfortunately, that group has held tremendous sway.</p>\n<p>My book would seem to be pessimistic and critical, but if you read it with open eyes, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s fundamentally and entirely optimistic because I420031m optimistic about humans. Most humans have enough to live off if they live off their brains. I420031m optimistic that humans are something different from and far better than computers. I&#8217;m optimistic that people can change. The <i>status quo</i> I&#8217;m criticising is fundamentally pessimistic. We have now the rise of these walled gardens which is fundamentally the only way people can make any money at all with their brains &#8211; the iPad and so on &#8211; and we&#8217;ve given up the core idealism of the PC era, which is that the same thing that allows you to receive communication allows you to send the communication. iPad is not going to be a development tool for iPad apps any more than a kindle is a development tool for kindle apps, or an Xbox is a development tool for Xbox games.  By rejecting Ted&#8217;s world, we&#8217;ve created this system that divides people into two classes, which we&#8217;ve been trying to kill. That&#8217;s unfortunately the consequence of the open culture movement. It essentially demands so little of people that it insults them<br />\n<b><br />\nCan you see anything good that&#8217;s come out of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement\">free culture movement</a>?</b><br />\nNo. I think it&#8217;s been a disaster. In particular, there&#8217;s a generation of people who hold the ideals of the open culture movement as talismans of their identity and their friendship and all that&#8217;s good in the world. I&#8217;m sympathetic with that because i had to hold onto ideas that were wrong for many years. When an idea means something to you, regardless of whether it&#8217;s right or wrong, when it&#8217;s part of your identity, it&#8217;s reasonable to expect that it will take ten or twenty years for it to change. It&#8217;s very hard to change these kinds of ideas: that&#8217;s why so many religions and nationalisms and various foibles are so persistent. I offer my sympathy and patience.</p>\n<p>The open culture idea has been an absolute failure on every level. Everything that it can point to is a nostalgic recreation or something that&#8217;s existed in a far better form.</p>\n<p>If you compare the apps that are avail on the Apple ecosystem to those on the <a href=\"http://www.android.com/\">Google Android</a> one, it&#8217;s clear that the Apple ones are just better, more polished. It&#8217;s not just because people have a potential to make some money, whereas on the android it&#8217;s hopeless. Even though many people object to apple&#8217;s approval process, at least it does create a bit of an encapsulation so someone has to say, &#8216;OK, this is the thing we&#8217;re submitting&#8217;. That forces things to be wholes. On Android, everything is just sort of crappy. Anyone can see that. It just wouldn&#8217;t be honest to claim otherwise.</p>\n<p>If 30 years ago I had said in one of my talks, or if <a href=\"http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/\">[John Perry] Barlow</a> or <a href=\"http://www.kk.org/\">Kevin Kelly</a> had said, &#8216;in thirty years computers will be millions millions of times faster, and the great prize we&#8217;ll have is a new <span class=\"caps\">UNIX</span> release and an encyclopedia online!&#8217; people would have said, &#8216;that sounds really boring. The lessening of ambition &#8211; people have been so excited about the ideology that they don&#8217;t notice the actual stuff, which is all incredibly dull. Every little it of it existed anyway. I&#8217;d love to be able to say that there&#8217;s something wonderful that&#8217;s come out of the open culture movement, but i just can&#8217;t find it.</p>\n<p><b>As a digital optimist, what about from the web in general?</b><br />\nOh, I think the web has been a massive success story. I&#8217;m just incredibly enthused about the web. The web gave us the first empirical evidence that vast numbers of people really are creative, really do have things to offer, and really will do it &#8211; really will get their acts together. I am a huge enthusiast overall of what&#8217;s happening online. The stuff I don&#8217;t like is just this web 2.0 stuff. It regiments and anonymises people. The mob mentality. I think that&#8217;s a huge wrong turn.</p>\n<p><b>Finally, how did <a href=\"http://www.feynmanonline.com/\">Richard Feynman</a> influence your attitude to technology?

Unfortunately, I420031ve come to believe that was a huge mistake. That420031s not based on ideas, but on data. As I look at the real world of musicians and artists, I see that it's not working. We're not finding these legions of new middle class musicians making it without the studio systems; we420031re seeing very tiny token number of people who can get a little bit of publicity and then are never heard from again. It's just not good enough.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there's something that420031s a little hard to understand but it's an important concept: what happens to today's musician and journalists doesn't end there. If it were just that, we could come up with some new institution or social arrangement to keep them from starving, and to allow them to reproduce and such things. But instead it will eventually affect everybody. Consider the advice that's sometimes given to musicians - give away your music and sell the t-shirt. But the problem with that is of course it won't be many years at all before there are extremely cheap robots that can make a t-shirt of any design you can find on the Internet. And the value of that custom t-shirt goes to zero, just like the value of music you rip off the Internet and burn on a CD. That principle generalises. Whatever you do that's not given away on the Internet can be done by some robot if you go far enough in the future. The special part can be given away on the Internet. \r\n\r\nWe're faced with a stark decision: we give people a way to live off their brains in the future - to earn dignity, to not have to constantly sing for their supper - some kind of intellectual property rights, some way to have a bit of breathing room to grow, or we have to accept that our problem is socialism, that we420031re trying to shut down personal reinvention and self-determinism and want to create a system where people will be universally supported by some institution. I personally support the former. \r\n\r\nI call the alternative Digital Maoism because, unlike other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\">Marxists</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism\">Maoists</a> had this real distaste for people who were earning from their brains, or from their hearts and they worshipped the peasant, the person who's really toiling.  Every time we tell someone to give away the music and sell the t-shirt, we're saying, 420034Don't make your living in this more elevated way. Instead, reverse this technological progress as far as social progress in terms of ways to make a living, and choose a more physical way to make a living.420035 We're sending them own to peasanthood, very much like the Maoists have.\r\n\r\n<b>You sound like a digital utopian that's experienced the past 20 years of the web and has grown cynical. What was it specifically - the data - that helped to transform your thoughts from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism\">libertarian</a> ideal to what you've termed Digital Maoism.</b>\r\nIt's not libertarian because libertarians believe in money and commerce. That's the thing, the people who call themselves libertarians online are not at all. They're really some variation of Maoist or anarchist, but they're certainly not libertarian because they're not disavowing money as a means to make a living. Libertarianism is a false term for the movement that describes itself as that in the digital world. I didn't realise this until I looked at the data, and the data is a lot of musicians who are doing really badly, and journalists who are doing really badly, and you can't dismiss that data. You can't just think, 420034OK, we're 17 years into the web, let's wait another 17 years.420035 It's long enough to say we've performed an experiment. It was a worthy experiment, there's no shame in having a hypothesis that doesn't turn out well, but there's a tremendous amount of shame that should accrue if you ignore data about how you're hypothesis turned out because you just don't wish to see that data. And at some point, we just have to acknowledge what it is that we're seeing.\r\n\r\n<b>So what is the solution?</b>\r\nOf course, that's always harder. Criticism is always easier than constructive solutions. In <i>You Are Not A Gadget</i> I propose five different approaches to a solution. The one that I am the most hopeful about of those five is to return to <a href=\"http://www.almaden.ibm.com/almaden/npuc97/1996/tnelson.htm\">the very first vision of the web</a>, the first fresh version of how the web should be suggested a universal micropayment system: there'd be only one copy of something from a logical point of view; as far as you're concerned, there's only one copy of a creative thing, just like there's only one copy of a YouTube video or something on the Apple store, although it may be implemented that there are other copies waiting to be downloaded faster. For practical purposes, there's only one copy of a creative thing, and you pay a half penny every time you access it. There420031s one universal system so you don't need to keep a separate username or password every time you visit a place where there may be content. \r\n\r\nWhat we're doing right now with things like the iPad and the Kindle and Xbox Live is we're creating these empires that each have their own accounts. People can only accommodate a small number of these, for practical reasons, so we're creating this big studio system where everyone will have to go through one of these eight biggies, or three biggies, however many there are going to be. I'd much rather see a world of open access. In that world of open access, something remarkable would happen. Every once and a while, when you make some quirky comment on a blog or news story or you upload a video clip, instead of just a moment of fame for your pseudonym, you'll get fifty bucks, or a thousand bucks. The very first time that happens, you'll realise that you're a full-class citizen. You have the potential to make money from the system. Once you hit that point, you'll realise there's a social contract here. And then maybe you'll stop illegally downloading content for the same reason you don't break into houses or cars even though you could, because it's part of a system that's better for everybody.\r\n\r\n<b>I can see that people would try to game that system, like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party\">50 cent bloggers</a>, or <a href=\"http://valleywag.gawker.com/339271/denton-to-pay-bloggers-based-on-traffic\">Gawker</a>, which offers its bloggers money for putting successful content online. Wouldn't that create a lowest common denominator? People seeking to earn back based on what they think would be a hit?</b>\r\nI don't doubt that would happen, but let me point you to a number of empirical examples. \r\n\r\nMoney does help. People often ask me the question, \"we're drowning in information, there's so much of it, what can you do?\" The usual geeky answer is to build an intelligent software thing that will only give you the information you need. The problem is that artificial intelligence doesn't really exist. We don't know what 'meaning' is from a technical point of view, we don't know how the brain thinks from a technical point of view, and so we can't make the software. So instead we make a pseudo filter that uses keywords to pretend to understand you, and so you make yourself a moron in order to make the software look good. It's ridiculous. What should happen instead is there should be a micro-investment to enter the system. There should be tiny amount of postage on email: that would shut down spam immediately. \r\n\r\nThe idea of free an open access sounds good at first, but the reason it's not good is twofold. One, having everything freely accessible to everyone else actually just creates this mediocre mush. The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average that actually matters. But if it's a design or something that matters, that's just done by committee, and that's crap. What you really want is encapsulation. You want people who are able to introspect and groups who are able to get their ducks in a row and test results and think thoughts before they share, or if you're in the evolutionary process and are thinking deep though about life on earth, you want punctuated equilibrium. This could be approached from may different ways.\r\n\r\nTotal flat openness of everything to everything is actually not as good as encapsulated, punctuated openness, which is still just as open, but actually allows more complex and subtle differences to come out. \r\n\r\n<b>My interest is looking at the social phenomenon of the web. You talk about this open system is difficult to parse because you ultimately end in mediocrity. But what happens in cyberspace is you develop <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/marshall/www/papers/CyberBalkans.pdf\">cyberbalkanisation</a> (pdf).</b>\r\nThat's the same process. A hypothesis I420031ve been working on is that human beings, like many other species, are bimodal creatures: we can either function as individuals or we can function as members of a pack. This is not uncommon in the animal world. There's a switch inside us, deep in our spirit, that you can turn one way or the other. I'm sure it was adaptive in some past environment in which it was reinforced. However, in the context of civilisation, where we're trying to be decent to one another, it's almost always the case that our worst behaviour comes out when we're switched to the mob setting. The problem with a lot of software designs is that they switch us to that setting. \r\n\r\nWhat happens when you have a global mush is that people lose their identity, they become pseudonyms, they have no investment and no consequence in what they do. Whenever that situation exists, there's a sequence I find to be in common, whether it's a Jihadi chat site, or a chat site about beach balls or anything, is that in initially people aren't sure what the pack is, and there's a feeling out thing. Somebody tries to ridicule something else, and other people who want to play it safe join in so that they're not the target. And gradually, the pack forms and you can tell a pack is formed by two things: an internal enemy, and an external enemy. The internal enemy is the low person on the totem pole, who is dumped on, who gets ridiculed. And then there's the external enemy, the 'other'. And that's where the balkanization happens, which is extremely severe. What we have online is a total lack of communication across those boundaries. In the us, we're practically recreating the civil war over this. It's extraordinary. But this is exactly the inevitable consequence of matching the human spirit as it really exists, our true biology, with this open mush environment. \r\n\r\nWhen democracy functions well, or when markets function well, what happens is that the meanness in human spirit, the biological flaws in our spirit, are precisely countered by structures. I view democracy as the countering mirror image of biology. It's the thing that compensates for us as we really are, to allow us to act better than we otherwise would. That's the thing that the internet hasn't done.\r\n\r\nYoung idealists always confuse anarchy and democracy. So democracy is biologically realistic and anarchy is not. That's the difference.\r\n\r\n<b>You bring up pack mentality - we see this in playgrounds, we see this in other environments when it's not the web.</b>\r\nThat's because it comes from the people, not from the machine.\r\n\r\n<b>What you're suggesting then is that we have an apolitical system, an apolitical platform. But you present a compelling idea that the software designers are psychologically manipulating us, through the very way they're designing the systems. They're engaging us, they're using us in may ways in order to facilitate their particular application. Do you think they're aware of this?</b>\r\nNo, absolutely not. I'm not suggesting a conspiracy. I want to empahsise that I420031m not talking about some remote 'other'. These are my friends. I'm around the people I420031m talking about every day, constantly. If there were a conspiracy, i would surely know about it by now. I would have started it probably. It's not a conspiracy; what it is instead is religion.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is that there is a certain confluence of a set of ideas which give a new strategy for the denial of death and aging which was invented by <a href=\"http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/\">Alan Turing</a> just before his suicide as he was being tortured to death by the UK government with female hormones. Turing came up with this proposal for person-machine equivalence. I think he was in the process of dying from merely being human, from merely being a sexual creature. I think he imagined this more pristine, platonic technical form of life. That idea resonated with later generations of technologists who, unlike Turing, tended to have an Asberger-y personality. This is where the nerdy, geeky quality of computer stuff comes in. Mild Asbergers is much more common in males than females, and tends to be more common in qualitative intelligence. The whole feeling of that kind of cognition is to be a little bit separated from sexuality and social stuff. Turing offered this blueprint, where you can imagine that people and machines aren't all that different. One stream of technical culture took that approach to heart and eventually formulated a replica of traditional religions with a technical terminology: instead of the rapture, we have the singularity. All of the aspects of priesthood of weirdo fundamentalists are represented.\r\n<b>\r\nCan you describe the concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">singularity</a>.</b>\r\nThe singularity is when all of the computers get so smart that they take over, and they're so capacious that they scoop up the contents of our brains and we get to live forever. And this is not some fringe thought. This is a very central movement in the technological world. Next door to Google there's a whole <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\">Singularity University</a> where you can go and get a degree in this particular theology. It's well attended, it's expensive. \r\n\r\nGiven that there's this theological drive to equate people and computers, more and more designs have that quality. One of the reasons that the Web 2.0 stuff suppresses individuals and brings out this mob identity is that it allows us to pretend that the machine is becoming intelligent and doing work, and we do that by suppressing the people. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page\">Larry Page</a> can say that the Google server's coming alive, but that's only possible because we don't see the people behind the curtain.\r\n<b>\r\nWhat would you say are the unique elements, the unique aspects of human beings that cannot be replicated by computers?</b>\r\nI don't have any certainty about this, but what I suggest is we should be naturalists when it comes to reality at large. We shouldn't assume supernatural forces in nature because it makes it harder to understand nature, which is a beautiful thing to do. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should take a supernatural attitude towards ourselves. The reason why is that if you don't, if you're internally a naturalist and think of yourself as a form of machine, you write crap software. You have to respect people in a special way to write good software. Err on the side of assuming human specialness. I can give many arguments also that have to do with human consciousness and the nature of time, and those arguments are interesting, but fundamentally the argument is pragmatic: if you think that there's something specially supernatual about people, and there isn't, what harm is done. It's a little bit like <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/\">Pascal's Bargain</a> for the technological age. \r\n\r\nHowever, if people are special and we treat ourselves as if we aren420031t, and we act like machines, we act like members of a mob for the service of supposed machine intelligence, well, we'll have failed to enjoy or perhaps even have destroyed something beautiful. There's really no risk in treating oneself supernaturally, and really every risk in not doing so. \r\n<b>\r\nAs humanity, we are able to create and appreciate culture. One of your arguments is that culture is disintegrating. Are mash-ups and other repurposings not evidence of a sophisticated repackaging of culture?</b>\r\nThere's a fuzzy line here. Obviously, all of culture depends on something similar to a mash up, but the difference between real culture and fake culture is do you internalise the thing before you mash it. Does it become part of you. Is there some way your meaning, your person, your spirit, your understanding has actually touched this thing. Or is it just cut and paste, digital, a touch of novelty for a moment to get some attention, no connection to the people. What I compare it to is what missionaries do to native cultures. Missionaries preserved a little bit of Aztec music, but we don't really understand what it was really like because they destroyed the context, they just snapped out a little tiny piece of it, the bit that could be used to colour the European form. And that is what we do when we do a cheap mashup. \r\n\r\nA deep mashup is when you internalise the thing, and when it comes out it is both a reference to this thing and at the same time it's a piece of you, an expression. Culture involves some work, some risk, some exploration, some surprise. Cheap mashups are entirely the opposite of deep culture. But reference and reuse are obviously the core of culture too.\r\n\r\n<b>So, is your criticism that, as a group, as a social entity, we don't have those cornerstones that would have encouraged us to gather around a cultural artefact? Aren't mashups, blogposts and other online content those cornerstones that help define our common phenomena from the web?</b>\r\nNo, because the gathering is the monopoly. Maoists would say we want to flatten the hierarchy so let's make everyone a peasant, and we'll send you to the field. In fact, they were putting up their own hierarchy, which was the communist party in which there is obviously a strong sense of hierarchy. In the same way, there's a natural hierarchy of this mashable ritual stuff that's going on with these fake companies that don't even make money - like Facebook and Twitter. The owner of the server becomes the Lord, or Mao. There are two kinds of servers that accrue power: one is the advertising exchange, which is a monopoly, and that's Google. The other is the hedge fund computer which does exactly the same thing and siphons money out of the system at a very abstract level to the general detriment of everyone. In each case, the hierarchy is how meta you can be: to what degree can you be at the highest level, which corresponds nicely to how close you can be to the central server. That's the new hierarchy, and that's what everyone wants to climb.\r\n\r\n<b>Information has a hierarchy online as well, for example, Wikipedia. Even <a href=\"http://blog.jimmywales.com/\">Jimmy Wales</a> accepts that there must be hierarchy online. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianna_Huffington\">Arianna Huffington</a> accepts that hierarchy and elitism must exist in these spaces in order for information to be parsed and accessible to human beings. Even these new web elite - even these people who helped to bring forward the web 2.0 phenomenon are themselves engaging actively in a hierarchical structure. </b>\r\nI used to blog for Arianna. I was a top blogger, i was always right at the top, always featured every day I did it. But I stopped when I realised what it was doing to me. It was making me mean and into someone who played to the crowd too much.\r\n\r\nEncapsulation is crucial, and that implies hierarchy. The point of a hierarchy is not that we should impose a hierarchy, but that there should be a crucial fairness to it. There should be a sense of access and a sense of equity to achieve a point in the hierarchy. In other words, it should be a meritocracy. That's the crucial thing here. Google is not a meritocracy. It's a first arrival advantage. That can be seen very easily when you look at <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bing.com\">Bing</a> results and people just have their brand loyalty and they can't tell [which one is better]. The reason they can't tell is because artificial intelligence doesn't exist. With the hedge funds, it's a very similar thing: it's elitist access. The math isn't all that hard. It's access and position that gives you a hedge fund computer that lets you pull the money out of the system.\r\n\r\nWhat we should seek is not an end to hierarchy, but a fair, meritorious end to hierarchy. I think <a href=\"http://ted.hyperland.com/\">Ted Nelson</a>'s original idea would give us that.\r\n\r\n<b>I'd like to expand this a little more given that you've been in this space for such a long time. The web emerged from a particular ideology given the group of people who colonised it in the first place: they came primarily from the San Francisco area. Idealists. Arguably, there's an approach to the web that has come from that space. What would a web look like that came from somewhere like China or South America? Is it fundamentally what would have happened?</b>\r\nThe original idea for the web that ted nelson conceived would be, I believe, vastly superior to what we did instead. The reason Ted's idea didn't happen is partially because Ted wasn't a good manager, he wasn't the best person to bring it forward. Equally there were two classes of ideologues at the time who shouted him down. Neither of whom i have any sympathy for. One were the campus Maoists. There was tremendous leftist sensibility at this time, in the 70s and 80s. I remember situations where there would be people who'd shout Ted down at his talks, not letting him get a word in, only because he was interested in this idea of money in the digital world. He was the actual libertarian, and these anti-money people are not at all.\r\n\r\nThe other group were the people were those who thought that everyone wanted to be a massive couch potato and no one could offer anything. This was the most common thing you heard: nobody wants to be creative. Unfortunately, that group has held tremendous sway.\r\n\r\nMy book would seem to be pessimistic and critical, but if you read it with open eyes, you'll see that it's fundamentally and entirely optimistic because I420031m optimistic about humans. Most humans have enough to live off if they live off their brains. I420031m optimistic that humans are something different from and far better than computers. I'm optimistic that people can change. The <i>status quo</i> I'm criticising is fundamentally pessimistic. We have now the rise of these walled gardens which is fundamentally the only way people can make any money at all with their brains - the iPad and so on - and we've given up the core idealism of the PC era, which is that the same thing that allows you to receive communication allows you to send the communication. iPad is not going to be a development tool for iPad apps any more than a kindle is a development tool for kindle apps, or an Xbox is a development tool for Xbox games.  By rejecting Ted's world, we've created this system that divides people into two classes, which we've been trying to kill. That's unfortunately the consequence of the open culture movement. It essentially demands so little of people that it insults them\r\n<b>\r\nCan you see anything good that's come out of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement\">free culture movement</a>?</b>\r\nNo. I think it's been a disaster. In particular, there's a generation of people who hold the ideals of the open culture movement as talismans of their identity and their friendship and all that's good in the world. I'm sympathetic with that because i had to hold onto ideas that were wrong for many years. When an idea means something to you, regardless of whether it's right or wrong, when it's part of your identity, it's reasonable to expect that it will take ten or twenty years for it to change. It's very hard to change these kinds of ideas: that's why so many religions and nationalisms and various foibles are so persistent. I offer my sympathy and patience.\r\n\r\nThe open culture idea has been an absolute failure on every level. Everything that it can point to is a nostalgic recreation or something that's existed in a far better form.\r\n\r\nIf you compare the apps that are avail on the Apple ecosystem to those on the <a href=\"http://www.android.com/\">Google Android</a> one, it's clear that the Apple ones are just better, more polished. It's not just because people have a potential to make some money, whereas on the android it's hopeless. Even though many people object to apple's approval process, at least it does create a bit of an encapsulation so someone has to say, 'OK, this is the thing we're submitting'. That forces things to be wholes. On Android, everything is just sort of crappy. Anyone can see that. It just wouldn't be honest to claim otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf 30 years ago I had said in one of my talks, or if <a href=\"http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/\">[John Perry] Barlow</a> or <a href=\"http://www.kk.org/\">Kevin Kelly</a> had said, 'in thirty years computers will be millions millions of times faster, and the great prize we'll have is a new UNIX release and an encyclopedia online!' people would have said, 'that sounds really boring. The lessening of ambition - people have been so excited about the ideology that they don't notice the actual stuff, which is all incredibly dull. Every little it of it existed anyway. I'd love to be able to say that there's something wonderful that's come out of the open culture movement, but i just can't find it.\r\n\r\n<b>As a digital optimist, what about from the web in general?</b>\r\nOh, I think the web has been a massive success story. I'm just incredibly enthused about the web. The web gave us the first empirical evidence that vast numbers of people really are creative, really do have things to offer, and really will do it - really will get their acts together. I am a huge enthusiast overall of what's happening online. The stuff I don't like is just this web 2.0 stuff. It regiments and anonymises people. The mob mentality. I think that's a huge wrong turn.\r\n\r\n<b>Finally, how did <a href=\"http://www.feynmanonline.com/\">Richard Feynman</a> influence your attitude to technology? It seems technologists have a thing for him. You wouldn't think it; he was a theoretical physicist.</b>\r\nFeynman had a remarkable spirit, was a remarkable thinker on many many levels. For one thing, he's just such an appealing character. He also built some bridges between physics and computation that hadn't existed before. He was involved with some of the early cloud computing stuff with <a href=\"http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/hillis.html\">Danny Hillis</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines\">thinking machines</a> period. Of course, there's the nano stuff, which he pretty much initiated. \r\n\r\nHe's one of these personalities who bridges the nerd world and the other world. He had this breadth to his spirit, which is pretty unusual. Most people who speak 'nerd' can't really leave the lab, and he could.\r\n\r\nHe projected a kind of joy that is all too rare.", :name=>"observer-an-interview-with-jaron-lanier", :updated_at=>Thu Apr 29 16:00:21 +0100 2010, :id=>153, :is_draft=>true}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution/credits.shtml\">The Virtual Revolution</a> was a collaborative process, and many people from around the world contributed to its development.

After all, we can only bring to this digital tabula rasa what we already know and what we have gained from our existing experiences.\r\n\r\nDespite this, people like former US Vice-President <a href=\"http://www.algore.com/\">Al Gore</a> is an online optimist.\r\n\r\nWhen we spoke with him, he insisted that the global nature of the world wide web has the potential to change this, as different societies bring their different perspectives to bear on the web community.\r\n<b>\r\nHuman medium</b>\r\n\r\nIndeed, when I joined the inventor of the web - <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/\">Tim Berner's Lee</a> - in Ghana as he was travelling to remote villages to try to understand what could happen when the African continent, parts of which have only recently been physically connected to the rest of the web with high-speed broadband access, makes its contribution to the international dialogue.\r\n\r\nHowever, what I realised on this trip is that the imprint that most people in the African states will develop in their first experiences of the web will be based on what non-Africans have created.\r\n\r\nOur two decades of shaping this maturing technology his has led us to a tool that has been crafted in our image.\r\n\r\nWhen the <a href=\"http://wwwbbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution\">Virtual Revolution</a> team went to Abiriw, a rural village in the mountains outside Ghana's capital Accra, I was struck by how the kids in the local community centre used the web - they saw the world of information through the window of Google.\r\n\r\nThe search engine works on a principle of the \"madness\" or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds\">\"wisdom\" of crowds</a>, basing its results on which websites receive the most links to their pages.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the crowd to date has been non-Africans, and so the window that these kids are using for information is non-African. What kind of dogma does that transmit?\r\n\r\nAnd how does this reinforce the inequalities that exist between the developed and the developing world?\r\n\r\nUltimately, the web is a reflection of humanity, not a humanity-changer. We bring to it all of our other human foibles, warts and all.\r\n\r\n<b>The first episode of Digital Revolutions will be broadcast on 30 January at 2030 on BBC2</b>\r\n\r\n<i>This article originally appeared on the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8485833.stm\">BBC News website</a> on 29 January 2010</i>", :name=>"bbc-the-rise-of-the-digital-elite", :updated_at=>Sat Jan 30 01:33:20 +0000 2010, :id=>140, :is_draft=>false}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">The Observer</a><br />\nSunday 24 January 2010</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm\">gave a speech on internet freedom</a> at a journalism museum in Washington, arguing that the architecture of the web must be free from censorship and manipulation.

He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,&#8221; Stephen Fry told me. &#8220;He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. &#8220;It seemed like a great new world,&#8221; he enthused. &#8220;It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. &#8220;It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it. Anyone who has historically held control over the distribution of information 420023 governments, media, agents 420023 is having to reposition in the face of this information tsunami.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Individuals without great wealth or bases of power and the industrial world economy can exert influence on others who find their ideas resonating with them,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;It is inherently democratising and egalitarian and promotes a greater role for the rule of reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is always dangerous, however, to be blinded by idealism. The web is undoubtedly a transformative technology on a par with the printing press, but it&#8217;s difficult to believe that it will bring the end of inequality or will eradicate international conflict. In fact, some have learned to manipulate the web&#8217;s power for their own ends.</p>\n<p>When this sits well with our personal politics, we celebrate.

Teenagers in London can <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/\">organise mass protests on climate change</a>, rallying people from around the country to march on a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. But when the same techniques and tools are used to radicalise new recruits to fundamentalist causes, to attack a country&#8217;s banks and newspapers, or to promote propaganda within authoritarian states, the web becomes something to condemn.</p>\n<p>The debate becomes even more personal when you consider how our use of this overwhelmingly commercial space is transforming what privacy means in the 21st century.

Unfortunately, I420031ve come to believe that was a huge mistake. That420031s not based on ideas, but on data. As I look at the real world of musicians and artists, I see that it&#8217;s not working. We&#8217;re not finding these legions of new middle class musicians making it without the studio systems; we420031re seeing very tiny token number of people who can get a little bit of publicity and then are never heard from again. It&#8217;s just not good enough.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s something that420031s a little hard to understand but it&#8217;s an important concept: what happens to today&#8217;s musician and journalists doesn&#8217;t end there. If it were just that, we could come up with some new institution or social arrangement to keep them from starving, and to allow them to reproduce and such things. But instead it will eventually affect everybody. Consider the advice that&#8217;s sometimes given to musicians &#8211; give away your music and sell the t-shirt. But the problem with that is of course it won&#8217;t be many years at all before there are extremely cheap robots that can make a t-shirt of any design you can find on the Internet. And the value of that custom t-shirt goes to zero, just like the value of music you rip off the Internet and burn on a CD. That principle generalises. Whatever you do that&#8217;s not given away on the Internet can be done by some robot if you go far enough in the future. The special part can be given away on the Internet.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re faced with a stark decision: we give people a way to live off their brains in the future &#8211; to earn dignity, to not have to constantly sing for their supper &#8211; some kind of intellectual property rights, some way to have a bit of breathing room to grow, or we have to accept that our problem is socialism, that we420031re trying to shut down personal reinvention and self-determinism and want to create a system where people will be universally supported by some institution. I personally support the former.</p>\n<p>I call the alternative Digital Maoism because, unlike other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\">Marxists</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism\">Maoists</a> had this real distaste for people who were earning from their brains, or from their hearts and they worshipped the peasant, the person who&#8217;s really toiling.  Every time we tell someone to give away the music and sell the t-shirt, we&#8217;re saying, 420034Don&#8217;t make your living in this more elevated way. Instead, reverse this technological progress as far as social progress in terms of ways to make a living, and choose a more physical way to make a living.420035 We&#8217;re sending them own to peasanthood, very much like the Maoists have.</p>\n<p><b>You sound like a digital utopian that&#8217;s experienced the past 20 years of the web and has grown cynical. What was it specifically &#8211; the data &#8211; that helped to transform your thoughts from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism\">libertarian</a> ideal to what you&#8217;ve termed Digital Maoism.</b><br />\nIt&#8217;s not libertarian because libertarians believe in money and commerce. That&#8217;s the thing, the people who call themselves libertarians online are not at all. They&#8217;re really some variation of Maoist or anarchist, but they&#8217;re certainly not libertarian because they&#8217;re not disavowing money as a means to make a living. Libertarianism is a false term for the movement that describes itself as that in the digital world. I didn&#8217;t realise this until I looked at the data, and the data is a lot of musicians who are doing really badly, and journalists who are doing really badly, and you can&#8217;t dismiss that data. You can&#8217;t just think, 420034OK, we&#8217;re 17 years into the web, let&#8217;s wait another 17 years.420035 It&#8217;s long enough to say we&#8217;ve performed an experiment. It was a worthy experiment, there&#8217;s no shame in having a hypothesis that doesn&#8217;t turn out well, but there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of shame that should accrue if you ignore data about how you&#8217;re hypothesis turned out because you just don&#8217;t wish to see that data. And at some point, we just have to acknowledge what it is that we&#8217;re seeing.</p>\n<p><b>So what is the solution?</b><br />\nOf course, that&#8217;s always harder. Criticism is always easier than constructive solutions. In <i>You Are Not A Gadget</i> I propose five different approaches to a solution. The one that I am the most hopeful about of those five is to return to <a href=\"http://www.almaden.ibm.com/almaden/npuc97/1996/tnelson.htm\">the very first vision of the web</a>, the first fresh version of how the web should be suggested a universal micropayment system: there&#8217;d be only one copy of something from a logical point of view; as far as you&#8217;re concerned, there&#8217;s only one copy of a creative thing, just like there&#8217;s only one copy of a YouTube video or something on the Apple store, although it may be implemented that there are other copies waiting to be downloaded faster. For practical purposes, there&#8217;s only one copy of a creative thing, and you pay a half penny every time you access it. There420031s one universal system so you don&#8217;t need to keep a separate username or password every time you visit a place where there may be content.</p>\n<p>What we&#8217;re doing right now with things like the iPad and the Kindle and Xbox Live is we&#8217;re creating these empires that each have their own accounts. People can only accommodate a small number of these, for practical reasons, so we&#8217;re creating this big studio system where everyone will have to go through one of these eight biggies, or three biggies, however many there are going to be. I&#8217;d much rather see a world of open access. In that world of open access, something remarkable would happen. Every once and a while, when you make some quirky comment on a blog or news story or you upload a video clip, instead of just a moment of fame for your pseudonym, you&#8217;ll get fifty bucks, or a thousand bucks. The very first time that happens, you&#8217;ll realise that you&#8217;re a full-class citizen. You have the potential to make money from the system. Once you hit that point, you&#8217;ll realise there&#8217;s a social contract here. And then maybe you&#8217;ll stop illegally downloading content for the same reason you don&#8217;t break into houses or cars even though you could, because it&#8217;s part of a system that&#8217;s better for everybody.</p>\n<p><b>I can see that people would try to game that system, like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party\">50 cent bloggers</a>, or <a href=\"http://valleywag.gawker.com/339271/denton-to-pay-bloggers-based-on-traffic\">Gawker</a>, which offers its bloggers money for putting successful content online. Wouldn&#8217;t that create a lowest common denominator? People seeking to earn back based on what they think would be a hit?</b><br />\nI don&#8217;t doubt that would happen, but let me point you to a number of empirical examples.</p>\n<p>Money does help. People often ask me the question, &#8220;we&#8217;re drowning in information, there&#8217;s so much of it, what can you do?&#8221; The usual geeky answer is to build an intelligent software thing that will only give you the information you need. The problem is that artificial intelligence doesn&#8217;t really exist. We don&#8217;t know what &#8216;meaning&#8217; is from a technical point of view, we don&#8217;t know how the brain thinks from a technical point of view, and so we can&#8217;t make the software. So instead we make a pseudo filter that uses keywords to pretend to understand you, and so you make yourself a moron in order to make the software look good. It&#8217;s ridiculous. What should happen instead is there should be a micro-investment to enter the system. There should be tiny amount of postage on email: that would shut down spam immediately.</p>\n<p>The idea of free an open access sounds good at first, but the reason it&#8217;s not good is twofold. One, having everything freely accessible to everyone else actually just creates this mediocre mush. The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there&#8217;s a single numeric average that actually matters. But if it&#8217;s a design or something that matters, that&#8217;s just done by committee, and that&#8217;s crap. What you really want is encapsulation. You want people who are able to introspect and groups who are able to get their ducks in a row and test results and think thoughts before they share, or if you&#8217;re in the evolutionary process and are thinking deep though about life on earth, you want punctuated equilibrium. This could be approached from may different ways.</p>\n<p>Total flat openness of everything to everything is actually not as good as encapsulated, punctuated openness, which is still just as open, but actually allows more complex and subtle differences to come out.</p>\n<p><b>My interest is looking at the social phenomenon of the web. You talk about this open system is difficult to parse because you ultimately end in mediocrity. But what happens in cyberspace is you develop <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/marshall/www/papers/CyberBalkans.pdf\">cyberbalkanisation</a> (pdf).</b><br />\nThat&#8217;s the same process. A hypothesis I420031ve been working on is that human beings, like many other species, are bimodal creatures: we can either function as individuals or we can function as members of a pack. This is not uncommon in the animal world. There&#8217;s a switch inside us, deep in our spirit, that you can turn one way or the other. I&#8217;m sure it was adaptive in some past environment in which it was reinforced. However, in the context of civilisation, where we&#8217;re trying to be decent to one another, it&#8217;s almost always the case that our worst behaviour comes out when we&#8217;re switched to the mob setting. The problem with a lot of software designs is that they switch us to that setting.</p>\n<p>What happens when you have a global mush is that people lose their identity, they become pseudonyms, they have no investment and no consequence in what they do. Whenever that situation exists, there&#8217;s a sequence I find to be in common, whether it&#8217;s a Jihadi chat site, or a chat site about beach balls or anything, is that in initially people aren&#8217;t sure what the pack is, and there&#8217;s a feeling out thing. Somebody tries to ridicule something else, and other people who want to play it safe join in so that they&#8217;re not the target. And gradually, the pack forms and you can tell a pack is formed by two things: an internal enemy, and an external enemy. The internal enemy is the low person on the totem pole, who is dumped on, who gets ridiculed. And then there&#8217;s the external enemy, the &#8216;other&#8217;. And that&#8217;s where the balkanization happens, which is extremely severe. What we have online is a total lack of communication across those boundaries. In the us, we&#8217;re practically recreating the civil war over this. It&#8217;s extraordinary. But this is exactly the inevitable consequence of matching the human spirit as it really exists, our true biology, with this open mush environment.</p>\n<p>When democracy functions well, or when markets function well, what happens is that the meanness in human spirit, the biological flaws in our spirit, are precisely countered by structures. I view democracy as the countering mirror image of biology. It&#8217;s the thing that compensates for us as we really are, to allow us to act better than we otherwise would. That&#8217;s the thing that the internet hasn&#8217;t done.</p>\n<p>Young idealists always confuse anarchy and democracy. So democracy is biologically realistic and anarchy is not. That&#8217;s the difference.</p>\n<p><b>You bring up pack mentality &#8211; we see this in playgrounds, we see this in other environments when it&#8217;s not the web.</b><br />\nThat&#8217;s because it comes from the people, not from the machine.</p>\n<p><b>What you&#8217;re suggesting then is that we have an apolitical system, an apolitical platform. But you present a compelling idea that the software designers are psychologically manipulating us, through the very way they&#8217;re designing the systems. They&#8217;re engaging us, they&#8217;re using us in may ways in order to facilitate their particular application. Do you think they&#8217;re aware of this?</b><br />\nNo, absolutely not. I&#8217;m not suggesting a conspiracy. I want to empahsise that I420031m not talking about some remote &#8216;other&#8217;. These are my friends. I&#8217;m around the people I420031m talking about every day, constantly. If there were a conspiracy, i would surely know about it by now. I would have started it probably. It&#8217;s not a conspiracy; what it is instead is religion.</p>\n<p>What I propose is that there is a certain confluence of a set of ideas which give a new strategy for the denial of death and aging which was invented by <a href=\"http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/\">Alan Turing</a> just before his suicide as he was being tortured to death by the UK government with female hormones. Turing came up with this proposal for person-machine equivalence. I think he was in the process of dying from merely being human, from merely being a sexual creature. I think he imagined this more pristine, platonic technical form of life. That idea resonated with later generations of technologists who, unlike Turing, tended to have an Asberger-y personality. This is where the nerdy, geeky quality of computer stuff comes in. Mild Asbergers is much more common in males than females, and tends to be more common in qualitative intelligence. The whole feeling of that kind of cognition is to be a little bit separated from sexuality and social stuff. Turing offered this blueprint, where you can imagine that people and machines aren&#8217;t all that different. One stream of technical culture took that approach to heart and eventually formulated a replica of traditional religions with a technical terminology: instead of the rapture, we have the singularity. All of the aspects of priesthood of weirdo fundamentalists are represented.<br />\n<b><br />\nCan you describe the concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">singularity</a>.</b><br />\nThe singularity is when all of the computers get so smart that they take over, and they&#8217;re so capacious that they scoop up the contents of our brains and we get to live forever. And this is not some fringe thought. This is a very central movement in the technological world. Next door to Google there&#8217;s a whole <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\">Singularity University</a> where you can go and get a degree in this particular theology. It&#8217;s well attended, it&#8217;s expensive.</p>\n<p>Given that there&#8217;s this theological drive to equate people and computers, more and more designs have that quality. One of the reasons that the Web 2.0 stuff suppresses individuals and brings out this mob identity is that it allows us to pretend that the machine is becoming intelligent and doing work, and we do that by suppressing the people. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page\">Larry Page</a> can say that the Google server&#8217;s coming alive, but that&#8217;s only possible because we don&#8217;t see the people behind the curtain.<br />\n<b><br />\nWhat would you say are the unique elements, the unique aspects of human beings that cannot be replicated by computers?</b><br />\nI don&#8217;t have any certainty about this, but what I suggest is we should be naturalists when it comes to reality at large. We shouldn&#8217;t assume supernatural forces in nature because it makes it harder to understand nature, which is a beautiful thing to do.</p>\n<p>However, I think we should take a supernatural attitude towards ourselves. The reason why is that if you don&#8217;t, if you&#8217;re internally a naturalist and think of yourself as a form of machine, you write crap software. You have to respect people in a special way to write good software. Err on the side of assuming human specialness. I can give many arguments also that have to do with human consciousness and the nature of time, and those arguments are interesting, but fundamentally the argument is pragmatic: if you think that there&#8217;s something specially supernatual about people, and there isn&#8217;t, what harm is done. It&#8217;s a little bit like <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/\">Pascal&#8217;s Bargain</a> for the technological age.</p>\n<p>However, if people are special and we treat ourselves as if we aren420031t, and we act like machines, we act like members of a mob for the service of supposed machine intelligence, well, we&#8217;ll have failed to enjoy or perhaps even have destroyed something beautiful. There&#8217;s really no risk in treating oneself supernaturally, and really every risk in not doing so. <br />\n<b><br />\nAs humanity, we are able to create and appreciate culture. One of your arguments is that culture is disintegrating. Are mash-ups and other repurposings not evidence of a sophisticated repackaging of culture?</b><br />\nThere&#8217;s a fuzzy line here. Obviously, all of culture depends on something similar to a mash up, but the difference between real culture and fake culture is do you internalise the thing before you mash it. Does it become part of you. Is there some way your meaning, your person, your spirit, your understanding has actually touched this thing. Or is it just cut and paste, digital, a touch of novelty for a moment to get some attention, no connection to the people. What I compare it to is what missionaries do to native cultures. Missionaries preserved a little bit of Aztec music, but we don&#8217;t really understand what it was really like because they destroyed the context, they just snapped out a little tiny piece of it, the bit that could be used to colour the European form. And that is what we do when we do a cheap mashup.</p>\n<p>A deep mashup is when you internalise the thing, and when it comes out it is both a reference to this thing and at the same time it&#8217;s a piece of you, an expression. Culture involves some work, some risk, some exploration, some surprise. Cheap mashups are entirely the opposite of deep culture. But reference and reuse are obviously the core of culture too.</p>\n<p><b>So, is your criticism that, as a group, as a social entity, we don&#8217;t have those cornerstones that would have encouraged us to gather around a cultural artefact? Aren&#8217;t mashups, blogposts and other online content those cornerstones that help define our common phenomena from the web?</b><br />\nNo, because the gathering is the monopoly. Maoists would say we want to flatten the hierarchy so let&#8217;s make everyone a peasant, and we&#8217;ll send you to the field. In fact, they were putting up their own hierarchy, which was the communist party in which there is obviously a strong sense of hierarchy. In the same way, there&#8217;s a natural hierarchy of this mashable ritual stuff that&#8217;s going on with these fake companies that don&#8217;t even make money &#8211; like Facebook and Twitter. The owner of the server becomes the Lord, or Mao. There are two kinds of servers that accrue power: one is the advertising exchange, which is a monopoly, and that&#8217;s Google. The other is the hedge fund computer which does exactly the same thing and siphons money out of the system at a very abstract level to the general detriment of everyone. In each case, the hierarchy is how meta you can be: to what degree can you be at the highest level, which corresponds nicely to how close you can be to the central server. That&#8217;s the new hierarchy, and that&#8217;s what everyone wants to climb.</p>\n<p><b>Information has a hierarchy online as well, for example, Wikipedia. Even <a href=\"http://blog.jimmywales.com/\">Jimmy Wales</a> accepts that there must be hierarchy online. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianna_Huffington\">Arianna Huffington</a> accepts that hierarchy and elitism must exist in these spaces in order for information to be parsed and accessible to human beings. Even these new web elite &#8211; even these people who helped to bring forward the web 2.0 phenomenon are themselves engaging actively in a hierarchical structure. </b><br />\nI used to blog for Arianna. I was a top blogger, i was always right at the top, always featured every day I did it. But I stopped when I realised what it was doing to me. It was making me mean and into someone who played to the crowd too much.</p>\n<p>Encapsulation is crucial, and that implies hierarchy. The point of a hierarchy is not that we should impose a hierarchy, but that there should be a crucial fairness to it. There should be a sense of access and a sense of equity to achieve a point in the hierarchy. In other words, it should be a meritocracy. That&#8217;s the crucial thing here. Google is not a meritocracy. It&#8217;s a first arrival advantage. That can be seen very easily when you look at <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bing.com\">Bing</a> results and people just have their brand loyalty and they can&#8217;t tell [which one is better]. The reason they can&#8217;t tell is because artificial intelligence doesn&#8217;t exist. With the hedge funds, it&#8217;s a very similar thing: it&#8217;s elitist access. The math isn&#8217;t all that hard. It&#8217;s access and position that gives you a hedge fund computer that lets you pull the money out of the system.</p>\n<p>What we should seek is not an end to hierarchy, but a fair, meritorious end to hierarchy. I think <a href=\"http://ted.hyperland.com/\">Ted Nelson</a>&#8217;s original idea would give us that.</p>\n<p><b>I&#8217;d like to expand this a little more given that you&#8217;ve been in this space for such a long time. The web emerged from a particular ideology given the group of people who colonised it in the first place: they came primarily from the San Francisco area. Idealists. Arguably, there&#8217;s an approach to the web that has come from that space. What would a web look like that came from somewhere like China or South America? Is it fundamentally what would have happened?</b><br />\nThe original idea for the web that ted nelson conceived would be, I believe, vastly superior to what we did instead. The reason Ted&#8217;s idea didn&#8217;t happen is partially because Ted wasn&#8217;t a good manager, he wasn&#8217;t the best person to bring it forward. Equally there were two classes of ideologues at the time who shouted him down. Neither of whom i have any sympathy for. One were the campus Maoists. There was tremendous leftist sensibility at this time, in the 70s and 80s. I remember situations where there would be people who&#8217;d shout Ted down at his talks, not letting him get a word in, only because he was interested in this idea of money in the digital world. He was the actual libertarian, and these anti-money people are not at all.</p>\n<p>The other group were the people were those who thought that everyone wanted to be a massive couch potato and no one could offer anything. This was the most common thing you heard: nobody wants to be creative. Unfortunately, that group has held tremendous sway.</p>\n<p>My book would seem to be pessimistic and critical, but if you read it with open eyes, you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s fundamentally and entirely optimistic because I420031m optimistic about humans. Most humans have enough to live off if they live off their brains. I420031m optimistic that humans are something different from and far better than computers. I&#8217;m optimistic that people can change. The <i>status quo</i> I&#8217;m criticising is fundamentally pessimistic. We have now the rise of these walled gardens which is fundamentally the only way people can make any money at all with their brains &#8211; the iPad and so on &#8211; and we&#8217;ve given up the core idealism of the PC era, which is that the same thing that allows you to receive communication allows you to send the communication. iPad is not going to be a development tool for iPad apps any more than a kindle is a development tool for kindle apps, or an Xbox is a development tool for Xbox games.  By rejecting Ted&#8217;s world, we&#8217;ve created this system that divides people into two classes, which we&#8217;ve been trying to kill. That&#8217;s unfortunately the consequence of the open culture movement. It essentially demands so little of people that it insults them<br />\n<b><br />\nCan you see anything good that&#8217;s come out of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement\">free culture movement</a>?</b><br />\nNo. I think it&#8217;s been a disaster. In particular, there&#8217;s a generation of people who hold the ideals of the open culture movement as talismans of their identity and their friendship and all that&#8217;s good in the world. I&#8217;m sympathetic with that because i had to hold onto ideas that were wrong for many years. When an idea means something to you, regardless of whether it&#8217;s right or wrong, when it&#8217;s part of your identity, it&#8217;s reasonable to expect that it will take ten or twenty years for it to change. It&#8217;s very hard to change these kinds of ideas: that&#8217;s why so many religions and nationalisms and various foibles are so persistent. I offer my sympathy and patience.</p>\n<p>The open culture idea has been an absolute failure on every level. Everything that it can point to is a nostalgic recreation or something that&#8217;s existed in a far better form.</p>\n<p>If you compare the apps that are avail on the Apple ecosystem to those on the <a href=\"http://www.android.com/\">Google Android</a> one, it&#8217;s clear that the Apple ones are just better, more polished. It&#8217;s not just because people have a potential to make some money, whereas on the android it&#8217;s hopeless. Even though many people object to apple&#8217;s approval process, at least it does create a bit of an encapsulation so someone has to say, &#8216;OK, this is the thing we&#8217;re submitting&#8217;. That forces things to be wholes. On Android, everything is just sort of crappy. Anyone can see that. It just wouldn&#8217;t be honest to claim otherwise.</p>\n<p>If 30 years ago I had said in one of my talks, or if <a href=\"http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/\">[John Perry] Barlow</a> or <a href=\"http://www.kk.org/\">Kevin Kelly</a> had said, &#8216;in thirty years computers will be millions millions of times faster, and the great prize we&#8217;ll have is a new <span class=\"caps\">UNIX</span> release and an encyclopedia online!&#8217; people would have said, &#8216;that sounds really boring. The lessening of ambition &#8211; people have been so excited about the ideology that they don&#8217;t notice the actual stuff, which is all incredibly dull. Every little it of it existed anyway. I&#8217;d love to be able to say that there&#8217;s something wonderful that&#8217;s come out of the open culture movement, but i just can&#8217;t find it.</p>\n<p><b>As a digital optimist, what about from the web in general?</b><br />\nOh, I think the web has been a massive success story. I&#8217;m just incredibly enthused about the web. The web gave us the first empirical evidence that vast numbers of people really are creative, really do have things to offer, and really will do it &#8211; really will get their acts together. I am a huge enthusiast overall of what&#8217;s happening online. The stuff I don&#8217;t like is just this web 2.0 stuff. It regiments and anonymises people. The mob mentality.

Unfortunately, I420031ve come to believe that was a huge mistake. That420031s not based on ideas, but on data. As I look at the real world of musicians and artists, I see that it's not working. We're not finding these legions of new middle class musicians making it without the studio systems; we420031re seeing very tiny token number of people who can get a little bit of publicity and then are never heard from again. It's just not good enough.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there's something that420031s a little hard to understand but it's an important concept: what happens to today's musician and journalists doesn't end there. If it were just that, we could come up with some new institution or social arrangement to keep them from starving, and to allow them to reproduce and such things. But instead it will eventually affect everybody. Consider the advice that's sometimes given to musicians - give away your music and sell the t-shirt. But the problem with that is of course it won't be many years at all before there are extremely cheap robots that can make a t-shirt of any design you can find on the Internet. And the value of that custom t-shirt goes to zero, just like the value of music you rip off the Internet and burn on a CD. That principle generalises. Whatever you do that's not given away on the Internet can be done by some robot if you go far enough in the future. The special part can be given away on the Internet. \r\n\r\nWe're faced with a stark decision: we give people a way to live off their brains in the future - to earn dignity, to not have to constantly sing for their supper - some kind of intellectual property rights, some way to have a bit of breathing room to grow, or we have to accept that our problem is socialism, that we420031re trying to shut down personal reinvention and self-determinism and want to create a system where people will be universally supported by some institution. I personally support the former. \r\n\r\nI call the alternative Digital Maoism because, unlike other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism\">Marxists</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism\">Maoists</a> had this real distaste for people who were earning from their brains, or from their hearts and they worshipped the peasant, the person who's really toiling.  Every time we tell someone to give away the music and sell the t-shirt, we're saying, 420034Don't make your living in this more elevated way. Instead, reverse this technological progress as far as social progress in terms of ways to make a living, and choose a more physical way to make a living.420035 We're sending them own to peasanthood, very much like the Maoists have.\r\n\r\n<b>You sound like a digital utopian that's experienced the past 20 years of the web and has grown cynical. What was it specifically - the data - that helped to transform your thoughts from a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism\">libertarian</a> ideal to what you've termed Digital Maoism.</b>\r\nIt's not libertarian because libertarians believe in money and commerce. That's the thing, the people who call themselves libertarians online are not at all. They're really some variation of Maoist or anarchist, but they're certainly not libertarian because they're not disavowing money as a means to make a living. Libertarianism is a false term for the movement that describes itself as that in the digital world. I didn't realise this until I looked at the data, and the data is a lot of musicians who are doing really badly, and journalists who are doing really badly, and you can't dismiss that data. You can't just think, 420034OK, we're 17 years into the web, let's wait another 17 years.420035 It's long enough to say we've performed an experiment. It was a worthy experiment, there's no shame in having a hypothesis that doesn't turn out well, but there's a tremendous amount of shame that should accrue if you ignore data about how you're hypothesis turned out because you just don't wish to see that data. And at some point, we just have to acknowledge what it is that we're seeing.\r\n\r\n<b>So what is the solution?</b>\r\nOf course, that's always harder. Criticism is always easier than constructive solutions. In <i>You Are Not A Gadget</i> I propose five different approaches to a solution. The one that I am the most hopeful about of those five is to return to <a href=\"http://www.almaden.ibm.com/almaden/npuc97/1996/tnelson.htm\">the very first vision of the web</a>, the first fresh version of how the web should be suggested a universal micropayment system: there'd be only one copy of something from a logical point of view; as far as you're concerned, there's only one copy of a creative thing, just like there's only one copy of a YouTube video or something on the Apple store, although it may be implemented that there are other copies waiting to be downloaded faster. For practical purposes, there's only one copy of a creative thing, and you pay a half penny every time you access it. There420031s one universal system so you don't need to keep a separate username or password every time you visit a place where there may be content. \r\n\r\nWhat we're doing right now with things like the iPad and the Kindle and Xbox Live is we're creating these empires that each have their own accounts. People can only accommodate a small number of these, for practical reasons, so we're creating this big studio system where everyone will have to go through one of these eight biggies, or three biggies, however many there are going to be. I'd much rather see a world of open access. In that world of open access, something remarkable would happen. Every once and a while, when you make some quirky comment on a blog or news story or you upload a video clip, instead of just a moment of fame for your pseudonym, you'll get fifty bucks, or a thousand bucks. The very first time that happens, you'll realise that you're a full-class citizen. You have the potential to make money from the system. Once you hit that point, you'll realise there's a social contract here. And then maybe you'll stop illegally downloading content for the same reason you don't break into houses or cars even though you could, because it's part of a system that's better for everybody.\r\n\r\n<b>I can see that people would try to game that system, like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party\">50 cent bloggers</a>, or <a href=\"http://valleywag.gawker.com/339271/denton-to-pay-bloggers-based-on-traffic\">Gawker</a>, which offers its bloggers money for putting successful content online. Wouldn't that create a lowest common denominator? People seeking to earn back based on what they think would be a hit?</b>\r\nI don't doubt that would happen, but let me point you to a number of empirical examples. \r\n\r\nMoney does help. People often ask me the question, \"we're drowning in information, there's so much of it, what can you do?\" The usual geeky answer is to build an intelligent software thing that will only give you the information you need. The problem is that artificial intelligence doesn't really exist. We don't know what 'meaning' is from a technical point of view, we don't know how the brain thinks from a technical point of view, and so we can't make the software. So instead we make a pseudo filter that uses keywords to pretend to understand you, and so you make yourself a moron in order to make the software look good. It's ridiculous. What should happen instead is there should be a micro-investment to enter the system. There should be tiny amount of postage on email: that would shut down spam immediately. \r\n\r\nThe idea of free an open access sounds good at first, but the reason it's not good is twofold. One, having everything freely accessible to everyone else actually just creates this mediocre mush. The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average that actually matters. But if it's a design or something that matters, that's just done by committee, and that's crap. What you really want is encapsulation. You want people who are able to introspect and groups who are able to get their ducks in a row and test results and think thoughts before they share, or if you're in the evolutionary process and are thinking deep though about life on earth, you want punctuated equilibrium. This could be approached from may different ways.\r\n\r\nTotal flat openness of everything to everything is actually not as good as encapsulated, punctuated openness, which is still just as open, but actually allows more complex and subtle differences to come out. \r\n\r\n<b>My interest is looking at the social phenomenon of the web. You talk about this open system is difficult to parse because you ultimately end in mediocrity. But what happens in cyberspace is you develop <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/marshall/www/papers/CyberBalkans.pdf\">cyberbalkanisation</a> (pdf).</b>\r\nThat's the same process. A hypothesis I420031ve been working on is that human beings, like many other species, are bimodal creatures: we can either function as individuals or we can function as members of a pack. This is not uncommon in the animal world. There's a switch inside us, deep in our spirit, that you can turn one way or the other. I'm sure it was adaptive in some past environment in which it was reinforced. However, in the context of civilisation, where we're trying to be decent to one another, it's almost always the case that our worst behaviour comes out when we're switched to the mob setting. The problem with a lot of software designs is that they switch us to that setting. \r\n\r\nWhat happens when you have a global mush is that people lose their identity, they become pseudonyms, they have no investment and no consequence in what they do. Whenever that situation exists, there's a sequence I find to be in common, whether it's a Jihadi chat site, or a chat site about beach balls or anything, is that in initially people aren't sure what the pack is, and there's a feeling out thing. Somebody tries to ridicule something else, and other people who want to play it safe join in so that they're not the target. And gradually, the pack forms and you can tell a pack is formed by two things: an internal enemy, and an external enemy. The internal enemy is the low person on the totem pole, who is dumped on, who gets ridiculed. And then there's the external enemy, the 'other'. And that's where the balkanization happens, which is extremely severe. What we have online is a total lack of communication across those boundaries. In the us, we're practically recreating the civil war over this. It's extraordinary. But this is exactly the inevitable consequence of matching the human spirit as it really exists, our true biology, with this open mush environment. \r\n\r\nWhen democracy functions well, or when markets function well, what happens is that the meanness in human spirit, the biological flaws in our spirit, are precisely countered by structures. I view democracy as the countering mirror image of biology. It's the thing that compensates for us as we really are, to allow us to act better than we otherwise would. That's the thing that the internet hasn't done.\r\n\r\nYoung idealists always confuse anarchy and democracy. So democracy is biologically realistic and anarchy is not. That's the difference.\r\n\r\n<b>You bring up pack mentality - we see this in playgrounds, we see this in other environments when it's not the web.</b>\r\nThat's because it comes from the people, not from the machine.\r\n\r\n<b>What you're suggesting then is that we have an apolitical system, an apolitical platform. But you present a compelling idea that the software designers are psychologically manipulating us, through the very way they're designing the systems. They're engaging us, they're using us in may ways in order to facilitate their particular application. Do you think they're aware of this?</b>\r\nNo, absolutely not. I'm not suggesting a conspiracy. I want to empahsise that I420031m not talking about some remote 'other'. These are my friends. I'm around the people I420031m talking about every day, constantly. If there were a conspiracy, i would surely know about it by now. I would have started it probably. It's not a conspiracy; what it is instead is religion.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is that there is a certain confluence of a set of ideas which give a new strategy for the denial of death and aging which was invented by <a href=\"http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/\">Alan Turing</a> just before his suicide as he was being tortured to death by the UK government with female hormones. Turing came up with this proposal for person-machine equivalence. I think he was in the process of dying from merely being human, from merely being a sexual creature. I think he imagined this more pristine, platonic technical form of life. That idea resonated with later generations of technologists who, unlike Turing, tended to have an Asberger-y personality. This is where the nerdy, geeky quality of computer stuff comes in. Mild Asbergers is much more common in males than females, and tends to be more common in qualitative intelligence. The whole feeling of that kind of cognition is to be a little bit separated from sexuality and social stuff. Turing offered this blueprint, where you can imagine that people and machines aren't all that different. One stream of technical culture took that approach to heart and eventually formulated a replica of traditional religions with a technical terminology: instead of the rapture, we have the singularity. All of the aspects of priesthood of weirdo fundamentalists are represented.\r\n<b>\r\nCan you describe the concept of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\">singularity</a>.</b>\r\nThe singularity is when all of the computers get so smart that they take over, and they're so capacious that they scoop up the contents of our brains and we get to live forever. And this is not some fringe thought. This is a very central movement in the technological world. Next door to Google there's a whole <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\">Singularity University</a> where you can go and get a degree in this particular theology. It's well attended, it's expensive. \r\n\r\nGiven that there's this theological drive to equate people and computers, more and more designs have that quality. One of the reasons that the Web 2.0 stuff suppresses individuals and brings out this mob identity is that it allows us to pretend that the machine is becoming intelligent and doing work, and we do that by suppressing the people. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page\">Larry Page</a> can say that the Google server's coming alive, but that's only possible because we don't see the people behind the curtain.\r\n<b>\r\nWhat would you say are the unique elements, the unique aspects of human beings that cannot be replicated by computers?</b>\r\nI don't have any certainty about this, but what I suggest is we should be naturalists when it comes to reality at large. We shouldn't assume supernatural forces in nature because it makes it harder to understand nature, which is a beautiful thing to do. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should take a supernatural attitude towards ourselves. The reason why is that if you don't, if you're internally a naturalist and think of yourself as a form of machine, you write crap software. You have to respect people in a special way to write good software. Err on the side of assuming human specialness. I can give many arguments also that have to do with human consciousness and the nature of time, and those arguments are interesting, but fundamentally the argument is pragmatic: if you think that there's something specially supernatual about people, and there isn't, what harm is done. It's a little bit like <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/\">Pascal's Bargain</a> for the technological age. \r\n\r\nHowever, if people are special and we treat ourselves as if we aren420031t, and we act like machines, we act like members of a mob for the service of supposed machine intelligence, well, we'll have failed to enjoy or perhaps even have destroyed something beautiful. There's really no risk in treating oneself supernaturally, and really every risk in not doing so. \r\n<b>\r\nAs humanity, we are able to create and appreciate culture. One of your arguments is that culture is disintegrating. Are mash-ups and other repurposings not evidence of a sophisticated repackaging of culture?</b>\r\nThere's a fuzzy line here. Obviously, all of culture depends on something similar to a mash up, but the difference between real culture and fake culture is do you internalise the thing before you mash it. Does it become part of you. Is there some way your meaning, your person, your spirit, your understanding has actually touched this thing. Or is it just cut and paste, digital, a touch of novelty for a moment to get some attention, no connection to the people. What I compare it to is what missionaries do to native cultures. Missionaries preserved a little bit of Aztec music, but we don't really understand what it was really like because they destroyed the context, they just snapped out a little tiny piece of it, the bit that could be used to colour the European form. And that is what we do when we do a cheap mashup. \r\n\r\nA deep mashup is when you internalise the thing, and when it comes out it is both a reference to this thing and at the same time it's a piece of you, an expression. Culture involves some work, some risk, some exploration, some surprise. Cheap mashups are entirely the opposite of deep culture. But reference and reuse are obviously the core of culture too.\r\n\r\n<b>So, is your criticism that, as a group, as a social entity, we don't have those cornerstones that would have encouraged us to gather around a cultural artefact? Aren't mashups, blogposts and other online content those cornerstones that help define our common phenomena from the web?</b>\r\nNo, because the gathering is the monopoly. Maoists would say we want to flatten the hierarchy so let's make everyone a peasant, and we'll send you to the field. In fact, they were putting up their own hierarchy, which was the communist party in which there is obviously a strong sense of hierarchy. In the same way, there's a natural hierarchy of this mashable ritual stuff that's going on with these fake companies that don't even make money - like Facebook and Twitter. The owner of the server becomes the Lord, or Mao. There are two kinds of servers that accrue power: one is the advertising exchange, which is a monopoly, and that's Google. The other is the hedge fund computer which does exactly the same thing and siphons money out of the system at a very abstract level to the general detriment of everyone. In each case, the hierarchy is how meta you can be: to what degree can you be at the highest level, which corresponds nicely to how close you can be to the central server. That's the new hierarchy, and that's what everyone wants to climb.\r\n\r\n<b>Information has a hierarchy online as well, for example, Wikipedia. Even <a href=\"http://blog.jimmywales.com/\">Jimmy Wales</a> accepts that there must be hierarchy online. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianna_Huffington\">Arianna Huffington</a> accepts that hierarchy and elitism must exist in these spaces in order for information to be parsed and accessible to human beings. Even these new web elite - even these people who helped to bring forward the web 2.0 phenomenon are themselves engaging actively in a hierarchical structure. </b>\r\nI used to blog for Arianna. I was a top blogger, i was always right at the top, always featured every day I did it. But I stopped when I realised what it was doing to me. It was making me mean and into someone who played to the crowd too much.\r\n\r\nEncapsulation is crucial, and that implies hierarchy. The point of a hierarchy is not that we should impose a hierarchy, but that there should be a crucial fairness to it. There should be a sense of access and a sense of equity to achieve a point in the hierarchy. In other words, it should be a meritocracy. That's the crucial thing here. Google is not a meritocracy. It's a first arrival advantage. That can be seen very easily when you look at <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bing.com\">Bing</a> results and people just have their brand loyalty and they can't tell [which one is better]. The reason they can't tell is because artificial intelligence doesn't exist. With the hedge funds, it's a very similar thing: it's elitist access. The math isn't all that hard. It's access and position that gives you a hedge fund computer that lets you pull the money out of the system.\r\n\r\nWhat we should seek is not an end to hierarchy, but a fair, meritorious end to hierarchy. I think <a href=\"http://ted.hyperland.com/\">Ted Nelson</a>'s original idea would give us that.\r\n\r\n<b>I'd like to expand this a little more given that you've been in this space for such a long time. The web emerged from a particular ideology given the group of people who colonised it in the first place: they came primarily from the San Francisco area. Idealists. Arguably, there's an approach to the web that has come from that space. What would a web look like that came from somewhere like China or South America? Is it fundamentally what would have happened?</b>\r\nThe original idea for the web that ted nelson conceived would be, I believe, vastly superior to what we did instead. The reason Ted's idea didn't happen is partially because Ted wasn't a good manager, he wasn't the best person to bring it forward. Equally there were two classes of ideologues at the time who shouted him down. Neither of whom i have any sympathy for. One were the campus Maoists. There was tremendous leftist sensibility at this time, in the 70s and 80s. I remember situations where there would be people who'd shout Ted down at his talks, not letting him get a word in, only because he was interested in this idea of money in the digital world. He was the actual libertarian, and these anti-money people are not at all.\r\n\r\nThe other group were the people were those who thought that everyone wanted to be a massive couch potato and no one could offer anything. This was the most common thing you heard: nobody wants to be creative. Unfortunately, that group has held tremendous sway.\r\n\r\nMy book would seem to be pessimistic and critical, but if you read it with open eyes, you'll see that it's fundamentally and entirely optimistic because I420031m optimistic about humans. Most humans have enough to live off if they live off their brains. I420031m optimistic that humans are something different from and far better than computers. I'm optimistic that people can change. The <i>status quo</i> I'm criticising is fundamentally pessimistic. We have now the rise of these walled gardens which is fundamentally the only way people can make any money at all with their brains - the iPad and so on - and we've given up the core idealism of the PC era, which is that the same thing that allows you to receive communication allows you to send the communication. iPad is not going to be a development tool for iPad apps any more than a kindle is a development tool for kindle apps, or an Xbox is a development tool for Xbox games.  By rejecting Ted's world, we've created this system that divides people into two classes, which we've been trying to kill. That's unfortunately the consequence of the open culture movement. It essentially demands so little of people that it insults them\r\n<b>\r\nCan you see anything good that's come out of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement\">free culture movement</a>?</b>\r\nNo. I think it's been a disaster. In particular, there's a generation of people who hold the ideals of the open culture movement as talismans of their identity and their friendship and all that's good in the world. I'm sympathetic with that because i had to hold onto ideas that were wrong for many years. When an idea means something to you, regardless of whether it's right or wrong, when it's part of your identity, it's reasonable to expect that it will take ten or twenty years for it to change. It's very hard to change these kinds of ideas: that's why so many religions and nationalisms and various foibles are so persistent. I offer my sympathy and patience.\r\n\r\nThe open culture idea has been an absolute failure on every level. Everything that it can point to is a nostalgic recreation or something that's existed in a far better form.\r\n\r\nIf you compare the apps that are avail on the Apple ecosystem to those on the <a href=\"http://www.android.com/\">Google Android</a> one, it's clear that the Apple ones are just better, more polished. It's not just because people have a potential to make some money, whereas on the android it's hopeless. Even though many people object to apple's approval process, at least it does create a bit of an encapsulation so someone has to say, 'OK, this is the thing we're submitting'. That forces things to be wholes. On Android, everything is just sort of crappy. Anyone can see that. It just wouldn't be honest to claim otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf 30 years ago I had said in one of my talks, or if <a href=\"http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/\">[John Perry] Barlow</a> or <a href=\"http://www.kk.org/\">Kevin Kelly</a> had said, 'in thirty years computers will be millions millions of times faster, and the great prize we'll have is a new UNIX release and an encyclopedia online!' people would have said, 'that sounds really boring. The lessening of ambition - people have been so excited about the ideology that they don't notice the actual stuff, which is all incredibly dull. Every little it of it existed anyway. I'd love to be able to say that there's something wonderful that's come out of the open culture movement, but i just can't find it.\r\n\r\n<b>As a digital optimist, what about from the web in general?</b>\r\nOh, I think the web has been a massive success story. I'm just incredibly enthused about the web. The web gave us the first empirical evidence that vast numbers of people really are creative, really do have things to offer, and really will do it - really will get their acts together. I am a huge enthusiast overall of what's happening online. The stuff I don't like is just this web 2.0 stuff. It regiments and anonymises people. The mob mentality. I think that's a huge wrong turn.\r\n\r\n<b>Finally, how did <a href=\"http://www.feynmanonline.com/\">Richard Feynman</a> influence your attitude to technology? It seems technologists have a thing for him. You wouldn't think it; he was a theoretical physicist.</b>\r\nFeynman had a remarkable spirit, was a remarkable thinker on many many levels. For one thing, he's just such an appealing character. He also built some bridges between physics and computation that hadn't existed before. He was involved with some of the early cloud computing stuff with <a href=\"http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/hillis.html\">Danny Hillis</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines\">thinking machines</a> period. Of course, there's the nano stuff, which he pretty much initiated. \r\n\r\nHe's one of these personalities who bridges the nerd world and the other world. He had this breadth to his spirit, which is pretty unusual. Most people who speak 'nerd' can't really leave the lab, and he could.\r\n\r\nHe projected a kind of joy that is all too rare.", :name=>"observer-an-interview-with-jaron-lanier", :updated_at=>Thu Apr 29 16:00:21 +0100 2010, :id=>153, :is_draft=>true}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution/credits.shtml\">The Virtual Revolution</a> was a collaborative process, and many people from around the world contributed to its development.

It aims to identify the true political, economic, social and psychological implications of this new technology. I spoke to an extraordinary cast of characters including the web pioneers, the e-entrepreneurs, and the sceptics who have seen it all before.</p>\n<p>We identified the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog1.shtml\">new power brokers in our society</a>, whose non-traditional ascents through the web have challenged hundreds of years of hierarchy. We found the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog2.shtml\">kids who took down the economic, communication and political pillars of an entire country</a> with the press of a button. We looked at the tactics extremists use to radicalise new recruits, and compared them to the methods that have proved so successful in getting a generation that had been dismissed as dispassionate involved in politics.</p>\n<p>We also looked at how the trails of information that we leave across the web are not only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog3.shtml\">redefining privacy</a>, but are creating feedback loops that may be narrowing our horizons, rather than opening our eyes to the new. And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.</p>\n<p>I started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,&#8221; Stephen Fry told me. &#8220;He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. &#8220;It seemed like a great new world,&#8221; he enthused. &#8220;It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. &#8220;It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it.

It is a position that stands in stark contrast with the approach of countries, including China, Egypt and Iran, that seek to curb access 420023 and while there was a whiff of economic self-protectionism in Clinton's words, she opened up the floor to a global discussion about the potential revolutionary power of this invention.\r\n\r\nLess than two decades after it came into being, the web is now a pawn in an international public policy debate that could create rifts between nations so deep that they lay the foundation for future wars.\r\n\r\nFor the past year, I have been <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/tag/digital%20revolution\">working</a> on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/virtualrevolution\">Virtual Revolution</a>, a four-part documentary series for BBC2, co-produced by the Open University. It aims to identify the true political, economic, social and psychological implications of this new technology. I spoke to an extraordinary cast of characters including the web pioneers, the e-entrepreneurs, and the sceptics who have seen it all before.\r\n\r\nWe identified the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog1.shtml\">new power brokers in our society</a>, whose non-traditional ascents through the web have challenged hundreds of years of hierarchy. We found the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog2.shtml\">kids who took down the economic, communication and political pillars of an entire country</a> with the press of a button. We looked at the tactics extremists use to radicalise new recruits, and compared them to the methods that have proved so successful in getting a generation that had been dismissed as dispassionate involved in politics.\r\n\r\nWe also looked at how the trails of information that we leave across the web are not only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog3.shtml\">redefining privacy</a>, but are creating feedback loops that may be narrowing our horizons, rather than opening our eyes to the new. And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.\r\n\r\nI started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.\r\n\r\n\"Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,\" Stephen Fry told me. \"He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.\"\r\n\r\nFry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. \"It seemed like a great new world,\" he enthused. \"It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.\"\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. \"It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it. Anyone who has historically held control over the distribution of information 420023 governments, media, agents 420023 is having to reposition in the face of this information tsunami.\r\n\r\n\"Individuals without great wealth or bases of power and the industrial world economy can exert influence on others who find their ideas resonating with them,\" Gore said. \"It is inherently democratising and egalitarian and promotes a greater role for the rule of reason.\"\r\n\r\nIt is always dangerous, however, to be blinded by idealism. The web is undoubtedly a transformative technology on a par with the printing press, but it's difficult to believe that it will bring the end of inequality or will eradicate international conflict.

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Coquet Valley was a pillaging ground for bands of Reivers who attacked and burned the town with terrifying frequency.  Near the town&#8217;s impressive All Saints&#8217; Parish Church stands the doorway and site of the seventeenth century Three Half Moons Inn, where the Earl of Derwentwater stayed with his followers in 1715 prior to marching into a heavy defeat in battle, at Preston.</p>\n<p>Lord Armstrong&#8217;s Home (Cragside, now in the ownership of the National Trust) was the first house in the world to be lit by hydro electricity.

The Castle was first restored, primarily as a fortress, by the 1st Lord Percy of Alnwick in the early 1300&#8217;s and portions of this restoration remain today, including the Abbot&#8217;s Tower, the Middle Gateway and the Constable&#8217;s Tower. Since then generations of Percys have continued to make their mark. During the late 17th century the Castle fell into decay until Elizabeth Seymour and her husband Hugh Smithson, later to become the first Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, took up the challenge and turned it into a family residence of &#8220;gothick&#8221; style with the help of architects such as Robert Adam and the landscape designer, Capability Brown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it&#8217;s in the stunning town of Alnwick, which you can find out more about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnwick\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>BedeWorld</b><br />\n&#8220;Wayne&#8217;s World for 7th Century monks&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>From the official website:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The extraordinary life of the Venerable Bede (AD 673-735) created a rich legacy that is celebrated today at Bede&#8217;s World, Jarrow, where Bede lived and worked 1300 years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Who on earth is this Venerable Bede?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bede was born in AD 673 on the lands of the monastery.

Bede spent the rest of his life in the monastery. He was ordained deacon at the age of 19 and priest at 30. He observed the Rule of the monastery and was punctilious in his attendance in choir at the daily offices. Outside of his time in choir, he worked as scholar and teacher; he records that &#8220;It has always been my delight to learn or to teach or to write&#8221;.

Had a typical English picnic, with scotch eggs, flasks of tea and rain. A first all around.\r\n\r\nBack to <a href=\"http://www.hexhamnet.co.uk\">Hexham</a>.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nHexham and its surroundings have a wealth of experiences to offer the visitor. Overlooking the beautiful Tyne valley, its medieval buildings form an imposing skyline. At the centre of these is Hexham Abbey, dating from 674AD and a must for any visitor. The town's market is held in its shadow every Tuesday, and its narrow streets are a magnet for shoppers. \r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nHexham is surrounded by some of the most beautiful countryside you could wish to see. Historic Hexhamshire gives way to the Tyne Valley, and then the lonely Northumberland hills. Charming villages such as Corbridge and Bellingham are well worth a visit, and the area has some of the best walking around, not to mention the country pubs.

The town has a pleasant mix of old stone and newer brick-built properties.  Although technically a town with a proposal a year or so back to install a town mayor (defeated) everyone still tends to call it a village and it has a village feel about it.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nRothbury has had a turbulent and bloody history.  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Coquet Valley was a pillaging ground for bands of Reivers who attacked and burned the town with terrifying frequency.  Near the town's impressive All Saints' Parish Church stands the doorway and site of the seventeenth century Three Half Moons Inn, where the Earl of Derwentwater stayed with his followers in 1715 prior to marching into a heavy defeat in battle, at Preston.\r\n\r\nLord Armstrong's Home (Cragside, now in the ownership of the National Trust) was the first house in the world to be lit by hydro electricity.  The Hall and its majestic grounds are situated  two miles east of the town. Travelling west you pass through some of the most exquisite and peaceful countryside in Northumberland.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<b>Morpeth</b>\r\nAn historic village, classified by the National Trust.\r\n\r\n<i>From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpeth,_Northumberland\">Wikipedia</a></i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nMorpeth is the county town of Northumberland, England. It is situated on the River Wansbeck which flows east through the town. The town is a mile from the A1, which bypasses it. Since 1981, it has been the administrative centre of the County of Northumberland. In the 2001 census the town had a population of 13,833.

The Castle was first restored, primarily as a fortress, by the 1st Lord Percy of Alnwick in the early 1300's and portions of this restoration remain today, including the Abbot's Tower, the Middle Gateway and the Constable's Tower. Since then generations of Percys have continued to make their mark. During the late 17th century the Castle fell into decay until Elizabeth Seymour and her husband Hugh Smithson, later to become the first Duke and Duchess of Northumberland, took up the challenge and turned it into a family residence of \"gothick\" style with the help of architects such as Robert Adam and the landscape designer, Capability Brown.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnd it's in the stunning town of Alnwick, which you can find out more about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnwick\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n<b>BedeWorld</b>\r\n\"Wayne's World for 7th Century monks\"\r\n\r\n<i>From the official website:</i>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary life of the Venerable Bede (AD 673-735) created a rich legacy that is celebrated today at Bede's World, Jarrow, where Bede lived and worked 1300 years ago.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWho on earth is this Venerable Bede?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nBede was born in AD 673 on the lands of the monastery. Of his family background we know nothing, save that he was entrusted at the age of 7 to the care of Benedict Biscop, the founder of the monastery, and then to Ceolfrith who in AD 681 was appointed Abbot of the new foundation at Jarrow. Bede spent the rest of his life in the monastery. He was ordained deacon at the age of 19 and priest at 30. He observed the Rule of the monastery and was punctilious in his attendance in choir at the daily offices. Outside of his time in choir, he worked as scholar and teacher; he records that \"It has always been my delight to learn or to teach or to write\". And he explains that \"I have made it my business, for my own benefit and that of my brothers, to make brief extracts from the works of the venerable fathers on the holy scriptures, or to add notes of my own to clarify their sense and interpretation\".\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<i>Want to know more? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede\">Wikipedia's got the answer</a>.</i>\r\n\r\n<b>\"Look up Winslow Homer, one of your countrymen, who lived in Cullercoats\"</b>\r\nHe did indeed.

There are 35 slots available on the 2010 mission (12-16th March, 2010) and applications are now open.\r\n\r\nDigital Mission to SXSWi 2010 is a fantastic opportunity to take advantage of the publicity and profile from a group of British companies attending SXSWi. Plus, there's a plethora of features to help develop relationships/partnerships with US companies, look into opening an office stateside and make valuable contacts for the future - not to mention brushing up on your industry knowledge.\r\n\r\nSouth by South West interactive takes place in Austin, Texas from 12-16th March 2009.\r\n\r\nEntries are welcome from a broad range of digital companies ranging from marketing agencies, through to ecommerce operators, mobile service providers, start-ups and any qualifying company that operates in the digital space.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell this mission is open to digital (web and mobile) companies that:\r\n\r\n    * Are innovative\r\n    * UK headquartered\r\n    * Are classified as an EU SME (small to medium enterprise, >250 employees)\r\n    * Have two years trading history, or failing that, compelling early-stage fast-track potential\r\n    * Can provide references from key sponsors/industry players\r\n    * Are ready to do business in the US OR potentially attractive to US investor\r\n    * Able to cover travel and accommodation costs\r\n    * Able to cover contribution towards event expenses (approx. 0243550 plus VAT) plus travel costs\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to see what a Chinwag/UKTI digital mission entails, check out their most recent and hugely successful trip to <a href=\"http://chinwag.com/digitalmission/nyc09\">New York for the Web2.0 Expo</a>, their trip to <a href=\"http://chinwag.com/digitalmission/lasf09\">LA and San Francisco for the Web2.0 conference</a>, and <a href=\"http://chinwag.com/digitalmission/sxsw09-activities\">last year's SXSWi activities</a> - truly awesome.\r\n\r\nIf that appeals, check out the <a href=\"http://chinwag.com/digitalmission/sxsw10-apply\">application information</a> and <a href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=mDUcBL74XHKep0DkIg5iug_3d_3d\">get applying now</a>.

Simply, unlike the capacity to learn &#8211; which can be measured &#8211; social and psychological concepts that are difficult to measure, like serendipity, are too multifaceted to be programmed in a way that can scale for the current capacity of computer processors.

Their diary entries were discussed during post-study interviews.<br/><strong>Analysis.</strong>0240An Emergent Themes Analysis was conducted to understand our data.<br/><strong>Results.</strong>0240We identified: 1) some key elements to support understanding of serendipity, 2) the influential role of context in serendipitous experiences, 3) a framework of understanding how serendipity happens and 4) the positive impacts of serendipity in people&#8217;s information research.<br/><strong>Conclusions.</strong>0240Our research suggests that a framework for classifying serendipity should consider aspects associated with the activity, the value of the information, the source of the information and the interaction between the individual and the context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A wonderful, empirical close reading of serendipity that is (crucially) <em>user-centred</em>. I would like to see this expanded into a cross-cultural analysis and with a larger sample size, to see how potential locative differences may affect the levels of abstraction that the authors used to define the serendipitous experiences that their participants produced.</p>\n<p>Also, this study is focussed on <em>information research</em> - i.e., search and/or discovery. Obviously, this is interesting and important for organisations like Google, Microsoft and any other technological service seeking to keep/attract a customer base by delivering relevance/value of the results.</p>\n<p>Lots of excellent reading material and references.</p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>", :title=>"A user-centred mobile diary study approach to understanding serendipity in information research", :external_id=>"11057400816", :created_at=>Wed Oct 05 12:12:33 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"link", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://informationr.net/ir/16-3/paper492.html", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Wed Oct 05 12:12:33 +0100 2011, :id=>1294, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>At the <a href=\"http://isea2011.sabanciuniv.edu/panel/serendipity-dead%E2%80%A6-long-live-serendipity\"><span class=\"caps\">ISEA</span> conference</a> in Istanbul, Turkey in September, I sat on a panel with the team behind <a href=\"http://www.serena.ac.uk\">serenA</a>, a cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional research group currently working on an <span class=\"caps\">EPSRC</span>-funded sandbox project to build a technology to produce serendipity.</p>\n<p>I am skeptical of computer solutions that portend to generate serendipitous outcomes, as I widely discuss on <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com\">The Serendipity Engine</a> tumblog (the home of my research with <a href=\"http://katrinajungnickel.com\">Kat Jungnickel</a> which recently received <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/bsa-serendipity-engine-wins-an-early-career-forum-support-from-t\">a small grant from the <span class=\"caps\">BSA</span></a>).

It is a working machine that uses bike parts, flower pots, cake, pulleys, light bulbs and other concrete objects to articulate the processes that could be translated into digital 420034solutions420035 that will re-engineer the potential dystopian social trajectories of current (social) software trends.<br/><br/>Each of the components of The Serendipity Engine highlights problems observed by digital theorists, designers and technologists with the way the Web currently works - linguistic barriers, echo chambers - by proposing one vision of how the technology can be re-tooled to increase serendipitous encounters. The aim of the machine is to inspire insight into the social and cultural effects of the decisions that developers make - often for commercial reasons and at the (explicit or implicit) requests of consumers - through simple, lateral demonstration.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can book now by <a href=\"http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayEvent&amp;id=1180\">following the link</a>.</p>", :title=>"Serendipity Engine at the Royal Institution", :external_id=>"10437543401", :created_at=>Tue Sep 20 10:00:00 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"regular", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/10437543401/serendipity-engine-at-the-royal-institution", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Tue Sep 20 10:00:00 +0100 2011, :id=>1296, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::ExternalPost @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>I&#8217;ve just realised that I&#8217;ve spent so much time defining the &#8220;serendipity&#8221; part of <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com\">this project</a> that I&#8217;ve forgotten to define the &#8220;engine&#8221; bit.</p>\n<p>Why is this important? Well, because it sets the boundaries for what it is that the serendipity engine will do.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><strong>Engine/Machine</strong></p>\n<p>The serendipity engine is No. 2 in a series of <a href=\"http://www.studioincite.com/katjungnickel/works/enquiry-machines/\">Enquiry Machines</a>. So <em>Engine</em> is conflated with0240<em>Machine</em>. Are they the same in terms of form and function?</p>\n<p><strong>Raging against the machine</strong></p>\n<p>A few frantic brainstormed notes that I just scribbled down say, &#8220;Machines are objects that you use to &#8216;do&#8217; something; they have an <em>objective</em>: render visible, create an output, solve a problem, demonstrate. A machine has an input and an output.&#8221; These hastily-considered parameters frame the construction of the thing: it has to have an in, where things are <em>introduced</em>, and an out, where things are <em>produced</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\">OED</a> defines a &#8220;machine&#8221; as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A material structure designed for a specific purpose, and related uses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>and</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>An apparatus constructed to perform a task or for some other purpose; also in derived senses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>In other words, a machine has a <em>purpose</em>. It has to <em>perform</em>. It has a <em>function</em>.0240It must <em>do</em> something. Will the Serendipity Engine <em>do</em>0240anything? Well, yes. <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/8637791073/the-problem-with-digital-serendipity-solutions-notes\">Kat &amp; I have agreed</a> that it has to render visible the social, cultural, temporal and material processes involved in generating a serendipitous outcome.0240</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Form and function</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>According to these definitions, it also has to have a physicality. And this is the thing that I&#8217;m asked a lot about: what will it look like? This next definition helps translate what I&#8217;m visualising in my head and what we will produce:0240</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A complex device, consisting of a number of interrelated parts, each having a definite function, together applying, using, or generating mechanical or (later) electrical power to perform a certain kind of work (often specified by a preceding verbal noun).</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Note: the association with <em>function</em>0240persists. </span></p>\n<p><span>At no point, however, does the definition of a machine indicate that the output must be physical. In fact:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A conceptual, abstract, or theoretical mechanism or device; spec. a model or mathematical abstraction of an existing or hypothetical computer. Cf. Turing Machine.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>But its constituent parts must be.</span></p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Engine=Machine?</strong></p>\n<p><span>An engine is one type of machine. The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62223?rskey=6Wdgz3&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid\">OED</a> defines it as &#8220;A machine, contraption, or mechanism.&#8221; Therefore in order to fit into the category, it must have a function, a purpose, an input and an output in order to demonstrate the concept and/or abstraction of the preceding verbal descriptor, <em>serendipity</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span>But what are the unique elements of an engine? Does an engine <em>do</em> something unique to other machines? The definitions of the word decree that an engine <em>transforms</em> something into something else:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A complicated machine with moving parts, for producing a given physical effect,0240esp. the conversion of power into motion.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>It propels things forward by converting a raw material into energy (steam, water etc), it calculates (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine\">Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine</a>), it computes (game engine). A machine can do something without transforming the essential properties of the input, like move something from A to B, but <strong>an engine is a subcategory that takes the0240ins and irrevocably converts them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>We have to make something that changes the essential nature of social experience into a serendipitous outcome. Or at least demonstrate what that might be.</span></p>", :title=>"Defining the machine", :external_id=>"10243689732", :created_at=>Thu Sep 15 18:30:38 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"regular", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/10243689732/defining-the-machine", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Thu Sep 15 18:30:38 +0100 2011, :id=>1297, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::ExternalPost @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><span>\n<p>Many thanks to the0240<a href=\"http://www.britsoc.co.uk/\">British Sociological Association</a>0240who have kindly supported0240<a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/\">The Serendipity Engine</a>0240with an0240<a href=\"http://www.britsoc.co.uk/ECForum/\">Early Career Forum</a>0240Professional Development Award.</p>\n<p>The funding will be used towards the development of the framework and methodology of the project.</p>\n</span></p>", :title=>"Serendipity Engine wins an Early Career Forum support from the BSA", :external_id=>"10235346377", :created_at=>Thu Sep 15 10:36:50 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"link", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/bsa-serendipity-engine-wins-an-early-career-forum-support-from-t", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Thu Sep 15 10:36:50 +0100 2011, :id=>1298, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>I&#8217;m curating a series this November at <a href=\"http://www.rigb.org/\">The Royal Institution of Great Britain</a> in London, and I&#8217;ve selected three events that fall under the umbrella, &#8220;Connections&#8221;: a lecture by science historian James Burke, an experimental classical music performance that takes its inspiration from neuronal patterns, and live demo of <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com\">a machine that produces serendipity</a>.

We have a mutual obsession with serendipity.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, many of our conversations have glanced on the concept; some have been recorded for posterity (on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2011/may/03/tech-weekly-art-love-bin-laden\">The Guardian&#8217;s Tech Weekly podcast</a> and on social media), others have been lost in the ephemera of meatspace. And while Chris concurs with my blue-sky social scientific conceptualisation, his work as a programmer has placed pragmatic limitations on how serendipity can actually be applied in cold, hard, binary (virtual) reality.</p>\n<p>Chris&#8217; work as a research scientist/technologist has evolved into an interest in large databases and the ways they can be used to help people discover new things. Case in point, Artfinder is a service that, using a database of all of the art in museums around the world, ostensibly helps people bump up into new art that they would probably like.</p>\n<p>This precisely sums up my problem with so-called digital serendipity solutions. And so this is precisely what Chris, Kat and I talked about.</p>\n<p>In the process, we landed on two key things:</p>\n<ul><li>to maximise the experience of happy accidents, web designers should curate not-quite-right solutions and let consumers do the processing</li>\n<li>it&#8217;s possible to produce coincidence online, but it&#8217;s <em>not</em> possible to engineer serendipity because we are always too active to achieve <em>flow</em></li>\n</ul><p>Here&#8217;s more:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\n<p><em><strong><!-- more --></strong></em></p>\nHow To Produce Web-Based Happy Accidents</strong></em></p>\n<p>Serendipity is &#8220;too important a mechanism to ignore,&#8221; says Chris, but the way the web works is as a <strong>filter</strong> - designed to give a specific answer - which ignores serendipity. This is a linear approach.</p>\n<p>He sees his alternative as <strong><em>curatorial</em></strong> - designed to give an outcome in which the result is a collection of &#8220;objects&#8221;. The connections and analyses - that which ultimately produces the sagacity which in turn returns the value (to the beneficiary) of serendipity - are the consumer&#8217;s responsibility. The pathway branches.</p>\n<p><strong>A branching pathway is much more difficult to code because it doesn&#8217;t scale.</strong></p>\n<p>Chris believes that the question we must ask as consumers is how we want to discover.</p>\n<p>On this concept, our conversation turned to <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/\">Matt Jones</a>, co-founder of travel-based social networking site <a href=\"http://www.dopplr.com\">Dopplr</a> &amp; now one of the principles at London design studio <a href=\"http://berglondon.com\">Berg</a>. Matt <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/2009/02/18/exporting-the-past-into-the-future-or-the-possibility-jelly-lives-on-the-hypersurface-of-the-present/\">described my own predilection nicely</a> in a post about to maximise coincidence (note: I didn&#8217;t say serendipity) based on physical location. This tweet from his stream (in the post) sums it up nicely:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://magicalnihilism.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/twitter-_-matt-jones_-i-still-maintain-perhaps.png?w=676&amp;h=430\" align=\"middle\" height=\"291\" width=\"458\"/></p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://scraplab.net/2009/02/06/hereish-nowish/\">Hereish/Nowish/Soonish/Good Enough</a>&#8221; aren&#8217;t being built into technological solutions because there&#8217;s a fetishisation of precision. For example, we don&#8217;t get search results that seem off the mark; we discarded services that didn&#8217;t offer relevance long ago.</p>\n<p>In his post, Matt argues that the future cannot be automated, but future <em>coincidences</em> might occur because of the future intentionality Dopplr users share with people they trust.0240</p>\n<p>BUT. A <em>serendipitous</em> discovery might occur via Dopplr because the system&#8217;s accompanying &#8220;visualisations, tips,  statistics and other tools&#8221; allow you to &#8220;reflect on your past travels&#8221;. This is a bedrock upon which  sagacity might bloom. It produces the methods and materials for you to make the connections yourself, drawing on your self-knowledge.</p>\n<p>Chris wants developers to complicate their creations even more: forcing  awkward connections by juxtaposing &#8220;unrelated&#8221; (but <em>thematic</em>)  content. But this demands thoughtfulness from the perspective of the <strong>curator-developer</strong>. It means that they must blend the randomness in so people don&#8217;t think of it as error.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anti-Flow</strong></em></p>\n<p>Is the web itself the problem? We are so active as we traverse across it that we can&#8217;t experience the magnificent <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29\">flow</a></em> (<span class=\"citation book\">see <a href=\"http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4751.asp\">Csikszentmihalyi</a>&#8217;s publications)</span>, allowing our minds bimble as we do something else utterly immersive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Flow</strong> is the <a title=\"Mental state\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state\">mental state</a> of operation in which a person in  an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full  involvement, and success in the process of the activity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I experience flow most frequently when I&#8217;m running or cycling through the city streets. What is exceptionally flow-ful is that when I am utterly physically focussed on not getting killed by a taxi, a bus or a truck, my mind is able to wander and process something else. I guess this is <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/5219111468/an-incomplete-list-of-serendipity-necessities-v1\">what Steven Johnson means</a> when he says one of the ingredients in the Good Idea Recipe is to take A Creative Walk, or A Hot Bath.</p>\n<p><strong>We can&#8217;t do that online.</strong> We go online to find stuff out, to do things. Our HeadRAM is totally taken up with these tasks and cannot wander, process, make lateral connections. We are fully occupied, but not in a way that encourages us to think about or make sense of anything else.</p>\n<p>&#8212;-</p>\n<p>My big question is, <strong>do developers really <em>want</em> to create serendipity? I think the answer is no. </strong>I think they want to create discovery machines that provide solutions to consumers because that&#8217;s why consumers go to the Web.</p>\n<p>Discovery can be managed, engineered, programmed. Serendipity - occasionally the product of discovery - cannot.</p>", :title=>"Curating in the anti-Flow.

We talked about a lot of things - talks we&#8217;re giving, building materials we need, dream design projects we&#8217;d like to work on - but most importantly we decided two things:</p>\n<p>024002400240 42004202400240 0240how the Serendipity Engine fits into the Enquiry Machine series<br/>02400240 024042004202400240 0240what&#8217;s problematic about the processes the technologists are using to build their serendipity engines</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.enquirymachines.com/\">The Enquiry Machines series</a> (aka &#8220;instruments of enquiry&#8221;) seeks to render visible the processes of enquiry. As Kat describes, &#8220;by making something visible, you ask the audience to ask questions about it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Our starting point in this EM#2 is to take as a framework/starting point <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>the Web</strong>. In this research project we&#8217;re seeking to understand <em>how serendipity is currently missing from the knowledge production environment</em>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, <strong>we seek to disrupt a culture that</strong> (we feel) <strong>frames the serendipity experience as solution-driven</strong>: the &#8220;serendipity engine&#8221; that commercial digital organisations (from Google to Artfinder) are trying to create will answer questions about how to produce serendipitous answers and outcomes. The engines they will produce will be self-fulfilling because they will be embedded in the ideologies of what are considered valid and relevant &#8220;answers&#8221; and &#8220;outcomes&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Their inputs will anticipate their outputs.</strong></p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound like accidental discovery to me. Nor does it sound like sound science.</p>\n<p><strong>Furthermore, we have no idea what those inputs are, or what they  are (explicitly or implicitly) motivated by.</strong></p>\n<p>Full disclosure: this project does have an output that is defined as serendipity. This has been a matter of debate between Kat and I. But the way we have come to terms with this is that our approach will render visible the processes that lead to our defined serendipity outcome, <em>not</em> occlude them. Serendipity must be defined in order to establish the frame through  which to identify the variables that can be used to enquire about it.  The definition can necessarily include what it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><strong>The nature of the Enquiry Machines is to inquire about enquiry</strong>: the outcome is itself the question. Thus, the Serendipity Engine demands that the outcome be the realisation (or not) of serendipity.0240</p>\n<p>We are currently establishing the basic theoretical infrastructure, identifying the independent variables described in social theory (our particular specialty) that have been found to contribute to an outcome of serendipity.</p>\n<p>In future, we hope to expand this infrastructure by enlisting people from other disciplines, approaches, frameworks, cultures, perspectives (from particle physics to mathematics to baking to knitting to performance to sound to art to pathological lying) to help define the inputs that will go into the engine. The reason we will open this out is because any leaderboard of what best predicts a serendipitous outcome will very likely change with each new input. That&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>The process of enquiry is not fixed. That is the problem with digital solutions to human experiences.</strong><br/><br/></p>", :title=>"The problem with digital serendipity solutions: notes from a meeting", :external_id=>"8637791073", :created_at=>Mon Aug 08 08:46:00 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"regular", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/8637791073/the-problem-with-digital-serendipity-solutions-notes", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Mon Aug 08 08:46:00 +0100 2011, :id=>1302, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::ExternalPost @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><em>cross-posted from <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/public-talks-sameas-serendipity-monday-8-august-2011\">alekskrotoski.com</a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/\">The  Serendipity Engine</a> gets its first outing on Monday 8 August at <a href=\"http://www.driverlondon.co.uk/\">The Driver</a> in London at <a href=\"http://sameas.us/events/serendipity\">sameAs</a>, an evening of  conversation and intellectual stimulation.

I am a social psychologist. I feel like I&#8217;m in a confessional. I am a social psychologist. And my bag, as it were, is social influence. Specifically, the influence that Web users exert over one another via the Web.</p>\n<p>My goodness, I can hear you say: that&#8217;s <i>exactly</i> our bread and butter! Well that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s &#8211; at least on the surface &#8211; a very good fit.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m here to tell you that the Web that you are creating &#8211; through your apps and services, your content and campaigns &#8211; is broken, and it is breaking more every time you help someone find what they&#8217;re looking for online. <b>Everything you do that gives someone what they want (or, indeed, the appearance of something they want) is undermining the original ethos of the communication technology that is revolutionising how we interact with one another</b>.</p>\n<p>Before I go in for the kill, let me back up a little bit.</p>\n<p><b>The Web is Made of Tubes</b><br />\nThe Web is an agnostic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes\">series of tubes</a> &#8211; yes tubes &#8211; that allow us to communicate. It was developed, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/10/rushes-sequences-tim-bernersle.shtml\">Tim Berners-Lee said</a>, to fulfill a need: a very lazy need to get stuff from other people without needed to actually speak with them.</p>\n<p>What has fascinated me about this technology is how it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">holds a mirror up to us</a>: it tells us what we value, it tells us what we want, it tells us something almost essential about what it means to be human.</p>\n<p>In my own research, I&#8217;ve discovered that <i>we form groups and communities in this space for the exact same reasons as we do offline</i>: to belong, to feel safe, to find out how we define ourselves according to who we deem to be similar and who we deem to be different. We cluster around attitudes and behaviours, forming communities of practice that transcend national boundaries, colour, socio-economic status, creed, age or gender.</p>\n<p>This is the original ethos of the Web.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the science bit.</p>\n<p><b>The Science Bit: Online Relationships and Attitude &amp; Behaviour Change</b><br />\n<b>We form relationships for the same reasons as we do offline</b> &#8211; and in much the same way: we seek out people who are similar to ourselves, with whom we can share experiences that form the basis of strong emotional bonds. We choose to be friends with people we meet regularly, reciprocally divulging information about ourselves in a way that heightens our similarity to one another, and encourages us to divulge even more information.</p>\n<p>There is a difference here: the medium &#8211; because it&#8217;s computer-mediated and therefore has <i>fewer interpersonal cues than meeting in meatspace</i> &#8211; fosters the sense that we are somehow less prone to the consequences of our actions (whether we are anonymous or use our real names), and so &#8211; despite the headlines &#8211; we have a tendency to be <b>more open and honest with online friends</b> than with their offline counterparts, and <b>we believe other people are being more open an honest with us too</b>.</p>\n<p>This allows us to generate strong feelings of <b>trust</b> more rapidly online, which in turn leads to a sense that another person is <b>credible</b> source of information, which in turn leads to <b>influence</b>.</p>\n<p>In fact, <b>we do attitude and behaviour change in the same way as offline</b>: <i>we are influenced by the people we know whom we compare ourselves with</i>, and whom we view as typical of our social identities &#8211; that sense of who we are and which group we belong to.</p>\n<p>But because we have less information about the other people online &#8211; we have a tendency to <i>conform</i> to the attitudes and behaviours that people whom we (superficially) believe are more like us demonstrate.</p>\n<p>But even more fascinating, we are more likely to fill in the blanks about people&#8217;s attitudes based on what we think they think, often perceiving their attitudes as <i>more extremely similar</i> to ourselves than they actually are.</p>\n<p>And so what we have online is <b>social conformity based on a social pressure that more than likely doesn&#8217;t exist or is believed to be something than it is</b>.</p>\n<p>What a house of cards.</p>\n<p><b>Silencing Serendpity</b><br />\nSo what happens when you combine these tendencies with the extrordinary world wide web &#8211; an information repository so vast that it&#8217;s impossible to parse it in a meaningful way? A library of information that demands filters because it&#8217;s so enormous, otherwise it would be as utterly useless as a novel of words rearranged in a completely random order?</p>\n<p>How on earth does Joe or Jane Web user decide which content to look at and what to be influenced by?</p>\n<p>Well, as a social psychologist, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s <b>social influence</b>.</p>\n<p>And web developers are getting pretty wise to this. You don&#8217;t have to look far to see them trying to do it: first the focus of the success of a website was about getting eyeballs through developing community. More recently, it was about personalising search, and encouraging social searching services. The premise was that you&#8217;d be more likely to believe the information that was delivered to you from someone you viewed as similar, trustworthy and credible. And we already know how those form.</p>\n<p>Then came the next evolution of social searching &#8211; the phase we&#8217;re currently in now: social network searching. And it&#8217;s doing a phenomenal job of filtering the Web. <span class=\"caps\">CNN</span> proudly announced last month that <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-01/tech/social.network.news_1_social-networking-sites-social-media-social-experience?_s=PM:TECH\">75% of its news hits come from links on social networking services</a> like Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<p>May I remind you that Facebook and Twitter are services that pair users with their friends.</p>\n<p>I would therefore say that what these services are doing is breaking the original ethos of Web.</p>\n<p><b>Losing the Vision</b><br />\nBack in the day, the pioneers who settled on the frontiers believed that we would open our minds to new and amazing things because of the vast quantities of information that we would have at our finger tips. And yes, thank you <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>, thank you the medium of mindlessly surfing, but I would propose that our courses through the Web &#8211; that seem at first random &#8211; are actually <i>determined by what we want to know and what we want to hear</i>.</p>\n<p>There are successful business models based exactly on this: amazon&#8217;s recommendation engine is a case in point. it gives you exactly what you think you want based on what it is that you already read &#8211; or what people who are similar to you already read &#8211; thus providing a more than certain sale and a good feeling overall.</p>\n<p>But this is ultimately leading to an <b>echo chamber</b>, which which we are deluded in thinking that <i>everyone else online thinks like we do, does what we do and believes what we do</i>. Our field of vision is narrowed and our differences become greater as we coagulate into different camps of interest.</p>\n<p>So much for the global group hug.</p>\n<p>Back in the day, the original founders of Web communities believed that the Web would be an engine of <b>self-actualisation</b>: that we would use the tools to play around with who we are, exploiting the apparent anonymity of the environment to try on new selves and use the open and honest feedback we received from other people to help shape our eventual attitudes and behaviours until we achieved the apex of our identities: our true selves.</p>\n<p>Well, what&#8217;s happened is that we have become fragmented, defined not only through the, frankly, obscene outpouring of information about ourselves that clogs the Web &#8211; I am more guilty than most &#8211; but by the links and tags and uploads that other people put up about us, forcing us instead of being the masters of our own fate, to be buffetted around by the tides of our online social exchanges.</p>\n<p><b>We are no longer the masters of our own virtual fates</b>: we now make decisions that are broadcast &#8211; willingly or unwillingly &#8211; in public, and recorded for posterity, which has a profound effect on what it is that we decide to do, the innovations we decide to adopt and the attitude we choose to express and hold.</p>\n<p>This is turning into doomsday predictions about the end of the world.</p>\n<p><b>How to Save the World</b><br />\nI assure you, I am not anti-the web. I make my business looking at the implications of it for the past, the present and potentially the future. I love it because it shows me the most extrordinary side of human beings: a face we have never before been able to see.</p>\n<p><b>But I would encourage you to stop and think before you deliver the next service, campaign or brand to your demographic on a plate.</b></p>\n<p>In order to ensure that the Web does not continue to break us, you must encourage <i>serendipity</i> &#8211; active and passive acts of randomness that make us better people, that bring us together with information that does not already confirm who we are, and does not restrict us ever more to being a demographic rather than individuals.</p>\n<p>Create services that <b>force people with different attitudes to bump up against one another</b>. Design systems that <b>force people to actively challenge information</b>. <b>Make it more difficult to be found</b>, so users have to navigate the rabbit holes of the Web to get to you.</p>\n<p>It may seem the antithesis of what it is you&#8217;re trying to do, but cracking a way to promote serendipity will be the <b>next greatest idea to come from this industry</b>. It will inspire new interactions with content and new narratives that will, in the end, make what you do more significant for the consumer. They will have had to find the end goal through their personal heroes journeys through the sea of Web stuff.</p>\n<p>And if it has a bonus feature of saving the world, you&#8217;ve done your good deed of the day.</p>\n<p><b>The End</b><br />\nWe are and can only be ourselves online because the Web is a communication tool. But it can be used to enhance us rather than restrict us. Use its interactivity to create new <i>connections</i>, new <i>stories</i> and new ways of <i>learning</i>. And that is when it will become a true revolution.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>", :title=>"[ENGAGE 2010] Supercharge your Serendipity", :created_at=>Thu Nov 18 09:28:41 +0000 2010, :sticky_tag_id=>nil, :body=>"I opened the <a href=\"https://www.iabuk.net/en/1/iabengage2010.html\">Internet Advertising Bureau's ENGAGE2010</a> summit in October (followed - intimidatingly - by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Bartz\">Carol Bartz, Yahoo!'s formidable CEO</a>) with a talk that aimed to provoke the advertising creatives in the room to consider what impact that their actions were having on the experiences of the people who consume the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\nIt proved a <a href=\"http://www.mad.co.uk/Logon/ArticleLogon.aspx?uiArticleID=1a673462-0d83-4ef4-86f6-f5a3be969a6b&uiNavigationItemID=&uiPageID=8453a00f-9d1a-404a-beda-339905b6b8b4&PipelinedPage=/Main/News/Articlex/1a6734620d834ef486f6f5a3be969a6b/Brands-should-think-before-they-advertise-online.html&PipelinedQueryString=uiArticleID%3d1a673462-0d83-4ef4-86f6-f5a3be969a6b%26uiNavigationItemID%3dd8f9fd23-813a-47b2-9696-31d9ca23a265%26\">controversial</a> <a href=\"http://www.iabuk.net/en/1/ukadvertiserscoulddobetter041110.mxs\">talk</a>, perhaps because I started out by saying that they were responsible for breaking the Web.\r\n\r\nWhat can I say, I was asked to provide a \"thought\" piece.

And we already know how those form.\r\n\r\nThen came the next evolution of social searching - the phase we're currently in now: social network searching. And it's doing a phenomenal job of filtering the Web. CNN proudly announced last month that <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-01/tech/social.network.news_1_social-networking-sites-social-media-social-experience?_s=PM:TECH\">75% of its news hits come from links on social networking services</a> like Facebook and Twitter. \r\n\r\nMay I remind you that Facebook and Twitter are services that pair users with their friends.\r\n\r\nI would therefore say that what these services are doing is breaking the original ethos of Web.\r\n\r\n<b>Losing the Vision</b>\r\nBack in the day, the pioneers who settled on the frontiers believed that we would open our minds to new and amazing things because of the vast quantities of information that we would have at our finger tips. And yes, thank you <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>, thank you the medium of mindlessly surfing, but I would propose that our courses through the Web - that seem at first random - are actually <i>determined by what we want to know and what we want to hear</i>.\r\n\r\nThere are successful business models based exactly on this: amazon's recommendation engine is a case in point. it gives you exactly what you think you want based on what it is that you already read - or what people who are similar to you already read - thus providing a more than certain sale and a good feeling overall.\r\n\r\nBut this is ultimately leading to an <b>echo chamber</b>, which which we are deluded in thinking that <i>everyone else online thinks like we do, does what we do and believes what we do</i>. Our field of vision is narrowed and our differences become greater as we coagulate into different camps of interest.\r\n\r\nSo much for the global group hug.\r\n\r\nBack in the day, the original founders of Web communities believed that the Web would be an engine of <b>self-actualisation</b>: that we would use the tools to play around with who we are, exploiting the apparent anonymity of the environment to try on new selves and use the open and honest feedback we received from other people to help shape our eventual attitudes and behaviours until we achieved the apex of our identities: our true selves.\r\n\r\nWell, what's happened is that we have become fragmented, defined not only through the, frankly, obscene outpouring of information about ourselves that clogs the Web - I am more guilty than most - but by the links and tags and uploads that other people put up about us, forcing us instead of being the masters of our own fate, to be buffetted around by the tides of our online social exchanges.\r\n\r\n<b>We are no longer the masters of our own virtual fates</b>: we now make decisions that are broadcast - willingly or unwillingly - in public, and recorded for posterity, which has a profound effect on what it is that we decide to do, the innovations we decide to adopt and the attitude we choose to express and hold.\r\n\r\nThis is turning into doomsday predictions about the end of the world.\r\n\r\n<b>How to Save the World</b>\r\nI assure you, I am not anti-the web. I make my business looking at the implications of it for the past, the present and potentially the future. I love it because it shows me the most extrordinary side of human beings: a face we have never before been able to see.\r\n\r\n<b>But I would encourage you to stop and think before you deliver the next service, campaign or brand to your demographic on a plate.</b>\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that the Web does not continue to break us, you must encourage <i>serendipity</i> - active and passive acts of randomness that make us better people, that bring us together with information that does not already confirm who we are, and does not restrict us ever more to being a demographic rather than individuals.\r\n\r\nCreate services that <b>force people with different attitudes to bump up against one another</b>. Design systems that <b>force people to actively challenge information</b>. <b>Make it more difficult to be found</b>, so users have to navigate the rabbit holes of the Web to get to you.\r\n\r\nIt may seem the antithesis of what it is you're trying to do, but cracking a way to promote serendipity will be the <b>next greatest idea to come from this industry</b>. It will inspire new interactions with content and new narratives that will, in the end, make what you do more significant for the consumer. They will have had to find the end goal through their personal heroes journeys through the sea of Web stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd if it has a bonus feature of saving the world, you've done your good deed of the day.\r\n\r\n<b>The End</b>\r\nWe are and can only be ourselves online because the Web is a communication tool. But it can be used to enhance us rather than restrict us. Use its interactivity to create new <i>connections</i>, new <i>stories</i> and new ways of <i>learning</i>. And that is when it will become a true revolution.\r\n\r\nThank you.", :name=>"engage-supercharge-your-serendipity", :updated_at=>Thu Nov 18 09:49:40 +0000 2010, :id=>193, :is_draft=>false}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>I was interviewed by <a href=\"http://www.howitworksdaily.com/\">How It Works</a>, and they&#8217;ve kindly opened the content &#8211; normally published on dead trees &#8211; online.</p>\n<p>Because I chose my Canon 7D <span class=\"caps\">DSLR</span> as my favourite piece of gadgetry, some of my <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/lifestream-1984\">1984 photos</a> were published too.

For example, is it possible to quantify social capital in some way and then use that as the basis of a game to influence attitudes and behaviours? When I re-posed this question on Twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Matt Locke </a>at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Channel 4 Education</a> (a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/jul/15/develop-games-awards-2010\">publishing hero</a> that has an award-winning stable of games for change) was adamant that, &#8220;games may create social capital, but it&#8217;s not a game in itself&#8230; It&#8217;s dangerous to think of social capital as an asset that can be measured or created&#8230; social capital is a story, not data.&#8221; I&#8217;d love your take on it too.</p>\n<p><!-- fold --></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hello and thank you very much for the warm invitation. When I found out I would be speaking with people who&nbsp; studied and designed ubiquitous computing, I must admit that I had a moment of panic. After all, you people are from the future, like the place inhabited by replicants and mechs and billboards that sense what you want and give it to you. That freaks me out. Frankly, you freak me out.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to retreat into a topic that I know something about and hopefully this will be of interest &#8211; and entertainment perhaps &#8211; to you, the people of the future, of what we were thinking about computers and digital technologies at the beginning of the 21st century. It was a time that was just beginning to grapple with the Internet &#8211; the most powerful communication tool known to civilization &#8211; and what it was that this tool taught us about ourselves as we left a wave of information about ourselves across the virtual ether.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a social psychologist, so I believe it is important to recognise what it is that can be understood through the data we leave behind in our daily lives &#8211; the digital footprint generated by our movements through virtual space, as it were. But I&#8217;m interested in the soft as well as the hard stuff that we can understand through our online activities. For me, the current volume of data available from our online activities is like finding the greatest treasure chest on the planet: finally &#8211; a phenomenal trove of human activity in natural settings that we can use to test theories about human behaviour and create new ones! In a natural environment! With real human responses! And no one acting differently because they feel they&#8217;re being watched by a lady in a white coat! Quick! Scrape everything, before the human subjects ethics committees realise!</p>\n<p>We know that our behaviours are captured online, and that these are used to create a digital identity that can be sold for corporate gain. The example of how Google pays for itself &#8211; through intel gleaned by slurping up our intentions &#8211; is a case in point. But it&#8217;s the softer, meat-space side that I&#8217;m interested in, how the ubiquity of computing will transform our relationships with one another and how we perceive ourselves. I feel these are important things to consider when designing applications and services that utilise ubiquitous computing, because of the social phenomena that emerge &#8211; through traceable or untraceable means &#8211; and what it is that, through more thoughtful design that includes features of social interaction, we can learn about humanity.</p>\n<p><b>active versus passive/computers versus meat-space</b><br />\nThere is currently, in most cases, a disconnect between us and the machine. Even in the case of Google, the best data capturing agent out there, we must be active in producing the information that they can use to generate our online identity. Their databases are full of our proactive behaviour, not our passive lives.</p>\n<p>So here we have a conflict between the digital space and the meat-space. I&#8217;d like to take a look at two of the things to think about when it comes to the bits that it&#8217;s more difficult to currently capture with digital technologies and when using the tech that&#8217;s coming close: the role of closeness, and how the feedback loop of constant updates is creating what I like to call a cult of me.</p>\n<p><b>the good old gooeyness of different types of friendship</b><br />\nFirst, let&#8217;s examine the basis of our social interactions: friendship. Friendship is simplest form of connection, and a feature of offline life that social networks in particular have exploited in their designs. In fact, they&#8217;re the basis of the business models that networks like Facebook and LinkedIn run on today: they operate on idea that individuals with friends will influence friends to join, thus increasing the value of the networks for themselves and for future customers. Facebook and LinkedIn then sell those connections on to highest bidders &#8211; in Facebook&#8217;s case, Microsoft &#8211; and you and your friends become the property of very rich organisations.</p>\n<p>Now, connection with people you care about or have similar interests with is what I believe is the basis for the success of the World Wide Web. It&#8217;s the social that made it more of a phenomenon than the simple library of information it provides.</p>\n<p>Of course, this wasn&#8217;t the original intention of the creators of the Web; Tim Berners-Lee did not think about this when he developed his hyper-text protocol. He&#8217;s an engineer and he was thinking about allowing people to connect with assets and content, not to one another. And so it&#8217;s up to social scientists like myself to try to understand how this very simple innovation became the vastly important interpersonal communication tool it is today. Even more importantly, it&#8217;s up to us to understand what it means for the offline person to be friends with someone else online.</p>\n<p>Anthropologists became the first people to really look at the communities that began to develop out of the technology as academics and fans, actually, of the Grateful Dead and others started interacting with one another via the Web. To the horror of the rest of the world, reports emerged about how human behaviours &#8211; like emotional connectedness, community, hierarchy, belongingness, stereotypes (the things that aren&#8217;t immediately obvious through binary digits) &#8211; were not only possible, but thrived in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>This is a controversial contention, of course. There are proponents &#8211; of course you can have meaningful friendships online &#8211; and there are detractors &#8211; how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space?</p>\n<p>Some of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they&#8217;re already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society&#8217;s annual conference.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you&#8217;ve never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it&#8217;s possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it&#8217;s even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>&#8216;s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a &#8217;communication closness&#8217;, and yes, it&#8217;s interesting, but I don&#8217;t think it captures everything.</p>\n<p>In fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who&#8217;s giving who money? That&#8217;s one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn&#8217;t know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, &#8220;Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Why is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another&#8217;s attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.<br />\n<b><br />\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b><br />\nSo I&#8217;ve talked about how it&#8217;s difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it&#8217;s actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?</p>\n<p>Well, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn&#8217;t mention, however, was that proximity &#8211; the experience of being &#8216;together&#8217; &#8211; is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are &#8216;close&#8217; not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online.

For example, is it possible to quantify social capital in some way and then use that as the basis of a game to influence attitudes and behaviours? When I re-posed this question on Twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Matt Locke </a>at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Channel 4 Education</a> (a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/jul/15/develop-games-awards-2010\">publishing hero</a> that has an award-winning stable of games for change) was adamant that, \"games may create social capital, but it's not a game in itself... It's dangerous to think of social capital as an asset that can be measured or created... social capital is a story, not data.\" I'd love your take on it too.\r\n\r\n<!-- fold -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHello and thank you very much for the warm invitation. When I found out I would be speaking with people who&nbsp; studied and designed ubiquitous computing, I must admit that I had a moment of panic. After all, you people are from the future, like the place inhabited by replicants and mechs and billboards that sense what you want and give it to you. That freaks me out. Frankly, you freak me out.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to retreat into a topic that I know something about and hopefully this will be of interest - and entertainment perhaps - to you, the people of the future, of what we were thinking about computers and digital technologies at the beginning of the 21st century. It was a time that was just beginning to grapple with the Internet - the most powerful communication tool known to civilization - and what it was that this tool taught us about ourselves as we left a wave of information about ourselves across the virtual ether.\r\n\r\nI'm a social psychologist, so I believe it is important to recognise what it is that can be understood through the data we leave behind in our daily lives - the digital footprint generated by our movements through virtual space, as it were. But I'm interested in the soft as well as the hard stuff that we can understand through our online activities. For me, the current volume of data available from our online activities is like finding the greatest treasure chest on the planet: finally - a phenomenal trove of human activity in natural settings that we can use to test theories about human behaviour and create new ones! In a natural environment! With real human responses! And no one acting differently because they feel they're being watched by a lady in a white coat! Quick! Scrape everything, before the human subjects ethics committees realise!\r\n\r\nWe know that our behaviours are captured online, and that these are used to create a digital identity that can be sold for corporate gain. The example of how Google pays for itself - through intel gleaned by slurping up our intentions - is a case in point. But it's the softer, meat-space side that I'm interested in, how the ubiquity of computing will transform our relationships with one another and how we perceive ourselves. I feel these are important things to consider when designing applications and services that utilise ubiquitous computing, because of the social phenomena that emerge - through traceable or untraceable means - and what it is that, through more thoughtful design that includes features of social interaction, we can learn about humanity.\r\n\r\n<b>active versus passive/computers versus meat-space</b>\r\nThere is currently, in most cases, a disconnect between us and the machine. Even in the case of Google, the best data capturing agent out there, we must be active in producing the information that they can use to generate our online identity. Their databases are full of our proactive behaviour, not our passive lives.\r\n\r\nSo here we have a conflict between the digital space and the meat-space. I'd like to take a look at two of the things to think about when it comes to the bits that it's more difficult to currently capture with digital technologies and when using the tech that's coming close: the role of closeness, and how the feedback loop of constant updates is creating what I like to call a cult of me.\r\n\r\n<b>the good old gooeyness of different types of friendship</b>\r\nFirst, let's examine the basis of our social interactions: friendship. Friendship is simplest form of connection, and a feature of offline life that social networks in particular have exploited in their designs. In fact, they're the basis of the business models that networks like Facebook and LinkedIn run on today: they operate on idea that individuals with friends will influence friends to join, thus increasing the value of the networks for themselves and for future customers. Facebook and LinkedIn then sell those connections on to highest bidders - in Facebook's case, Microsoft - and you and your friends become the property of very rich organisations.\r\n\r\nNow, connection with people you care about or have similar interests with is what I believe is the basis for the success of the World Wide Web. It's the social that made it more of a phenomenon than the simple library of information it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, this wasn't the original intention of the creators of the Web; Tim Berners-Lee did not think about this when he developed his hyper-text protocol. He's an engineer and he was thinking about allowing people to connect with assets and content, not to one another. And so it's up to social scientists like myself to try to understand how this very simple innovation became the vastly important interpersonal communication tool it is today. Even more importantly, it's up to us to understand what it means for the offline person to be friends with someone else online.\r\n\r\nAnthropologists became the first people to really look at the communities that began to develop out of the technology as academics and fans, actually, of the Grateful Dead and others started interacting with one another via the Web. To the horror of the rest of the world, reports emerged about how human behaviours - like emotional connectedness, community, hierarchy, belongingness, stereotypes (the things that aren't immediately obvious through binary digits) - were not only possible, but thrived in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nThis is a controversial contention, of course. There are proponents - of course you can have meaningful friendships online - and there are detractors - how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space? \r\n\r\nSome of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they're already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society's annual conference. \r\n\r\nI'd like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you've never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it's possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it's even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>'s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a 'communication closness', and yes, it's interesting, but I don't think it captures everything.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who's giving who money? That's one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do. \r\n\r\nI <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn't know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, \"Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat\".\r\n\r\nWhy is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another's attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.\r\n<b>\r\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b>\r\nSo I've talked about how it's difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it's actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?\r\n\r\nWell, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn't mention, however, was that proximity - the experience of being 'together' - is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are 'close' not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online. My mother, hilariously, sends me email responses to my twitter feeds and now uses words like 'nom nom nom' because I write that on my twitter updates.\r\n\r\nAlso, facilities like Twitter or Facebook or other social networks that are constantly updated give people a lot of information about which they can base a feeling of similarity on. Similarity online is a fascinating area. Because it's so lean, we have to rely on interpersonal cues that we extrapolate from the communication that's actively - proactively - distributed (check out more on this within the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Identity_model_of_Deindividuation_Effects_%28SIDE%29\">SIDE framework</a> from Martin Lea and Russell Spears). So, Facebook or Twitter updates give people minute-to-minute detail about what people are eating, the kinds of new stories they find important, who they're chatting with, the kinds of activities they take part in - and these help to form a basis of similarity. More likely it's a false basis - both because it's a constructed reality on the part of the person who's tweeting or updating, and because we as beasts insist on filling in the gaps with confirmatory content: stuff that makes us think that other people are actually more similar to ourselves than they really are.\r\n\r\nAnd here's a little aside - a cautionary tale, as it were - mine and others' research has shown that not only do we perceive people to be like us when they aren't (hold similar attitudes, do similar things), but we perceive them to be more extreme than us.

So here's a call to arms, clever future people: it's your job to create applications that can break this, to give us <b>serendipity</b> online, to force us to look at people we think are dissimilar, and to recognise that there are other views on the internet than those that are like ours.

She also charts how, out of the ashes, Google forged the business model that has come to dominate today&#8217;s web, offering a plethora of highly attractive, overtly free web services, including search, maps and video, that are in fact funded through a sophisticated and highly lucrative advertising system which trades on what we users look for.</p>\n<p>Aleks explores how web advertising is evolving further to become more targeted and relevant to individual consumers.

The programme looks at the dark corporate underbelly of the Web, and how it's transforming our notions of privacy and culture in the 21st century. It's also the one that excites me the most; I am a dystopian from way back, and I'm both thrilled and terrified to see how we have been complicit in our own <a href=\"http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/\">1984</a>. What does Google have on us? How is Amazon's recommendation system contradicting the most powerful opportunity for new inforamtion that the web offers - serendipity - and manipulating us into homogenous proles for its own benefit?\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vAeuxQuXXnw&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vAeuxQuXXnw&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nMagnificent. You can read more about these ideas in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/08/we-bought-the-eticket-were-tak.shtml\">my manifesto for this programme</a>, originally published on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution\">BBC's Digital Revolution blog</a> during pre-production.\r\n\r\nAs the film's Assistant Producer Jo Wade explains in an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8508814.stm\">article for the BBC today</a>, \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nEvery day in Britain millions of searches are carried out on Google for free. Every month we spend millions of hours on Facebook for free and read millions of articles from free newspapers.\r\n\r\nBut now look at it the other way round.\r\n\r\nEvery day Google gathers millions of search terms that help them refine their search system and give them a direct marketing bonanza that they keep for months.\r\n\r\nEvery week Facebook receives millions of highly personal status updates that are kept forever and are forming the basis of direct advertising revenue.\r\n\r\nEvery month free newspapers plant and track a cookie tracking device on your computer that tells them what your range of interests are and allows them to shape their adverts and in the future, even content around you.\r\n\r\nSo you're not just being watched, you're being traded. The currency has changed.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom the official site:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn the third programme of the series, Aleks gives the lowdown on how, for better and for worse, commerce has colonised the web - and reveals how web users are paying for what appear to be 'free' sites and services in hidden ways.\r\n\r\nJoined by some of the most influential business leaders of today's web, including Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon), Eric Schmidt (CEO of Google), Chad Hurley (CEO of YouTube), Bill Gates, Martha Lane Fox and Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix), Aleks traces how business, with varying degrees of success, has attempted to make money on the web.\r\n\r\nShe tells the inside story of the gold rush years of the dotcom bubble and reveals how retailers such as Amazon learned the lessons. She also charts how, out of the ashes, Google forged the business model that has come to dominate today's web, offering a plethora of highly attractive, overtly free web services, including search, maps and video, that are in fact funded through a sophisticated and highly lucrative advertising system which trades on what we users look for.\r\n\r\nAleks explores how web advertising is evolving further to become more targeted and relevant to individual consumers. Recommendation engines, pioneered by retailers such as Amazon, are also breaking down the barriers between commerce and consumer by marketing future purchases to us based on our previous choices.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the web appears to have brought about a revolution in convenience. But, as companies start to build up databases on our online habits and preferences, Aleks questions what this may mean for our notions of privacy and personal space in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDon't forget, you can play the spot-the-programme-three-pics in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/toastkid/sets/72157621257306475/\">production Flickr stream</a> while you watch, and I'll be on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a> as it broadcasts.", :name=>"virtual-revolution-the-cost-of-free", :updated_at=>Wed Feb 24 07:43:45 +0000 2010, :id=>147, :is_draft=>false}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">The Observer</a><br />\nSunday 24 January 2010</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm\">gave a speech on internet freedom</a> at a journalism museum in Washington, arguing that the architecture of the web must be free from censorship and manipulation.

And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.</p>\n<p>I started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,&#8221; Stephen Fry told me. &#8220;He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. &#8220;It seemed like a great new world,&#8221; he enthused. &#8220;It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. &#8220;It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it. Anyone who has historically held control over the distribution of information 420023 governments, media, agents 420023 is having to reposition in the face of this information tsunami.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Individuals without great wealth or bases of power and the industrial world economy can exert influence on others who find their ideas resonating with them,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;It is inherently democratising and egalitarian and promotes a greater role for the rule of reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is always dangerous, however, to be blinded by idealism. The web is undoubtedly a transformative technology on a par with the printing press, but it&#8217;s difficult to believe that it will bring the end of inequality or will eradicate international conflict. In fact, some have learned to manipulate the web&#8217;s power for their own ends.</p>\n<p>When this sits well with our personal politics, we celebrate. A <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/\">25-year-old from San Francisco</a> can create <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/haystack-good-luck-finding-that-needle/\">a piece of software</a> that opens up a channel of communication on the violent streets of post-election Iran, giving protesters the ability to transmit what is happening to the rest of the world. Teenagers in London can <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/\">organise mass protests on climate change</a>, rallying people from around the country to march on a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. But when the same techniques and tools are used to radicalise new recruits to fundamentalist causes, to attack a country&#8217;s banks and newspapers, or to promote propaganda within authoritarian states, the web becomes something to condemn.</p>\n<p>The debate becomes even more personal when you consider how our use of this overwhelmingly commercial space is transforming what privacy means in the 21st century. As we traipse across the web, our trails of personal information are captured and manipulated. We get services for free, but our actions are analysed to produce precisely targeted advertising that funds the companies behind the websites.</p>\n<p>The greatest shock to most people is that we willingly create this commercial pact when we think we&#8217;re alone. A Google search, for example, transcends the barrier between what we view as public and what we view as private. When we do a search on our computers at home, in the office or on the road, we have a misplaced sense we are transacting only with our machine. In fact, when we type a query in Google&#8217;s search box, we are divulging our intentions to a technology located across the planet, with hundreds of potential eyeballs sifting through our search terms for the perfect advertising match. Yet we still treat it like an oracle, asking it deeply personal questions and looking for answers in its computer brain.</p>\n<p>The surveillance implications for this are clear, but there are wider cultural implications when the money people behind the scenes get their rewards for feeding us exactly what we want. Amazon&#8217;s recommendation engine, Last.fm&#8217;s social music service, even news sites such as the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">Huffington Post</a>, reduce the possibility for serendipity by serving up what they think we want, channelling us into a loop of confirmation. As author <a href=\"http://rushkoff.com/\">Douglas Rushkoff</a> says: &#8220;The more like one of my kind of person I become, the less me I am, and the more I am a demographic type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Socially, this is as potentially damaging as what the extremists peddle; we are coagulating into tight-knit groups who reinforce our own beliefs.

Their diary entries were discussed during post-study interviews.<br/><strong>Analysis.</strong>0240An Emergent Themes Analysis was conducted to understand our data.<br/><strong>Results.</strong>0240We identified: 1) some key elements to support understanding of serendipity, 2) the influential role of context in serendipitous experiences, 3) a framework of understanding how serendipity happens and 4) the positive impacts of serendipity in people&#8217;s information research.<br/><strong>Conclusions.</strong>0240Our research suggests that a framework for classifying serendipity should consider aspects associated with the activity, the value of the information, the source of the information and the interaction between the individual and the context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A wonderful, empirical close reading of serendipity that is (crucially) <em>user-centred</em>. I would like to see this expanded into a cross-cultural analysis and with a larger sample size, to see how potential locative differences may affect the levels of abstraction that the authors used to define the serendipitous experiences that their participants produced.</p>\n<p>Also, this study is focussed on <em>information research</em> - i.e., search and/or discovery. Obviously, this is interesting and important for organisations like Google, Microsoft and any other technological service seeking to keep/attract a customer base by delivering relevance/value of the results.</p>\n<p>Lots of excellent reading material and references.</p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>", :title=>"A user-centred mobile diary study approach to understanding serendipity in information research", :external_id=>"11057400816", :created_at=>Wed Oct 05 12:12:33 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"link", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://informationr.net/ir/16-3/paper492.html", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Wed Oct 05 12:12:33 +0100 2011, :id=>1294, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>At the <a href=\"http://isea2011.sabanciuniv.edu/panel/serendipity-dead%E2%80%A6-long-live-serendipity\"><span class=\"caps\">ISEA</span> conference</a> in Istanbul, Turkey in September, I sat on a panel with the team behind <a href=\"http://www.serena.ac.uk\">serenA</a>, a cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional research group currently working on an <span class=\"caps\">EPSRC</span>-funded sandbox project to build a technology to produce serendipity.</p>\n<p>I am skeptical of computer solutions that portend to generate serendipitous outcomes, as I widely discuss on <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com\">The Serendipity Engine</a> tumblog (the home of my research with <a href=\"http://katrinajungnickel.com\">Kat Jungnickel</a> which recently received <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/bsa-serendipity-engine-wins-an-early-career-forum-support-from-t\">a small grant from the <span class=\"caps\">BSA</span></a>).

It is a working machine that uses bike parts, flower pots, cake, pulleys, light bulbs and other concrete objects to articulate the processes that could be translated into digital 420034solutions420035 that will re-engineer the potential dystopian social trajectories of current (social) software trends.<br/><br/>Each of the components of The Serendipity Engine highlights problems observed by digital theorists, designers and technologists with the way the Web currently works - linguistic barriers, echo chambers - by proposing one vision of how the technology can be re-tooled to increase serendipitous encounters. The aim of the machine is to inspire insight into the social and cultural effects of the decisions that developers make - often for commercial reasons and at the (explicit or implicit) requests of consumers - through simple, lateral demonstration.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can book now by <a href=\"http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayEvent&amp;id=1180\">following the link</a>.</p>", :title=>"Serendipity Engine at the Royal Institution", :external_id=>"10437543401", :created_at=>Tue Sep 20 10:00:00 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"regular", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/10437543401/serendipity-engine-at-the-royal-institution", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Tue Sep 20 10:00:00 +0100 2011, :id=>1296, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::ExternalPost @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>I&#8217;ve just realised that I&#8217;ve spent so much time defining the &#8220;serendipity&#8221; part of <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com\">this project</a> that I&#8217;ve forgotten to define the &#8220;engine&#8221; bit.</p>\n<p>Why is this important? Well, because it sets the boundaries for what it is that the serendipity engine will do.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><strong>Engine/Machine</strong></p>\n<p>The serendipity engine is No. 2 in a series of <a href=\"http://www.studioincite.com/katjungnickel/works/enquiry-machines/\">Enquiry Machines</a>. So <em>Engine</em> is conflated with0240<em>Machine</em>. Are they the same in terms of form and function?</p>\n<p><strong>Raging against the machine</strong></p>\n<p>A few frantic brainstormed notes that I just scribbled down say, &#8220;Machines are objects that you use to &#8216;do&#8217; something; they have an <em>objective</em>: render visible, create an output, solve a problem, demonstrate. A machine has an input and an output.&#8221; These hastily-considered parameters frame the construction of the thing: it has to have an in, where things are <em>introduced</em>, and an out, where things are <em>produced</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\">OED</a> defines a &#8220;machine&#8221; as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A material structure designed for a specific purpose, and related uses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>and</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>An apparatus constructed to perform a task or for some other purpose; also in derived senses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>In other words, a machine has a <em>purpose</em>. It has to <em>perform</em>. It has a <em>function</em>.0240It must <em>do</em> something. Will the Serendipity Engine <em>do</em>0240anything? Well, yes. <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/8637791073/the-problem-with-digital-serendipity-solutions-notes\">Kat &amp; I have agreed</a> that it has to render visible the social, cultural, temporal and material processes involved in generating a serendipitous outcome.0240</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Form and function</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>According to these definitions, it also has to have a physicality. And this is the thing that I&#8217;m asked a lot about: what will it look like? This next definition helps translate what I&#8217;m visualising in my head and what we will produce:0240</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A complex device, consisting of a number of interrelated parts, each having a definite function, together applying, using, or generating mechanical or (later) electrical power to perform a certain kind of work (often specified by a preceding verbal noun).</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Note: the association with <em>function</em>0240persists. </span></p>\n<p><span>At no point, however, does the definition of a machine indicate that the output must be physical. In fact:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A conceptual, abstract, or theoretical mechanism or device; spec. a model or mathematical abstraction of an existing or hypothetical computer. Cf. Turing Machine.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>But its constituent parts must be.</span></p>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Engine=Machine?</strong></p>\n<p><span>An engine is one type of machine. The <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62223?rskey=6Wdgz3&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid\">OED</a> defines it as &#8220;A machine, contraption, or mechanism.&#8221; Therefore in order to fit into the category, it must have a function, a purpose, an input and an output in order to demonstrate the concept and/or abstraction of the preceding verbal descriptor, <em>serendipity</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span>But what are the unique elements of an engine? Does an engine <em>do</em> something unique to other machines? The definitions of the word decree that an engine <em>transforms</em> something into something else:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A complicated machine with moving parts, for producing a given physical effect,0240esp. the conversion of power into motion.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>It propels things forward by converting a raw material into energy (steam, water etc), it calculates (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine\">Babbage&#8217;s Difference Engine</a>), it computes (game engine). A machine can do something without transforming the essential properties of the input, like move something from A to B, but <strong>an engine is a subcategory that takes the0240ins and irrevocably converts them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>We have to make something that changes the essential nature of social experience into a serendipitous outcome. Or at least demonstrate what that might be.</span></p>", :title=>"Defining the machine", :external_id=>"10243689732", :created_at=>Thu Sep 15 18:30:38 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"regular", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/10243689732/defining-the-machine", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Thu Sep 15 18:30:38 +0100 2011, :id=>1297, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::ExternalPost @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><span>\n<p>Many thanks to the0240<a href=\"http://www.britsoc.co.uk/\">British Sociological Association</a>0240who have kindly supported0240<a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/\">The Serendipity Engine</a>0240with an0240<a href=\"http://www.britsoc.co.uk/ECForum/\">Early Career Forum</a>0240Professional Development Award.</p>\n<p>The funding will be used towards the development of the framework and methodology of the project.</p>\n</span></p>", :title=>"Serendipity Engine wins an Early Career Forum support from the BSA", :external_id=>"10235346377", :created_at=>Thu Sep 15 10:36:50 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"link", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/bsa-serendipity-engine-wins-an-early-career-forum-support-from-t", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Thu Sep 15 10:36:50 +0100 2011, :id=>1298, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>I&#8217;m curating a series this November at <a href=\"http://www.rigb.org/\">The Royal Institution of Great Britain</a> in London, and I&#8217;ve selected three events that fall under the umbrella, &#8220;Connections&#8221;: a lecture by science historian James Burke, an experimental classical music performance that takes its inspiration from neuronal patterns, and live demo of <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com\">a machine that produces serendipity</a>.

We have a mutual obsession with serendipity.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, many of our conversations have glanced on the concept; some have been recorded for posterity (on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2011/may/03/tech-weekly-art-love-bin-laden\">The Guardian&#8217;s Tech Weekly podcast</a> and on social media), others have been lost in the ephemera of meatspace. And while Chris concurs with my blue-sky social scientific conceptualisation, his work as a programmer has placed pragmatic limitations on how serendipity can actually be applied in cold, hard, binary (virtual) reality.</p>\n<p>Chris&#8217; work as a research scientist/technologist has evolved into an interest in large databases and the ways they can be used to help people discover new things. Case in point, Artfinder is a service that, using a database of all of the art in museums around the world, ostensibly helps people bump up into new art that they would probably like.</p>\n<p>This precisely sums up my problem with so-called digital serendipity solutions. And so this is precisely what Chris, Kat and I talked about.</p>\n<p>In the process, we landed on two key things:</p>\n<ul><li>to maximise the experience of happy accidents, web designers should curate not-quite-right solutions and let consumers do the processing</li>\n<li>it&#8217;s possible to produce coincidence online, but it&#8217;s <em>not</em> possible to engineer serendipity because we are always too active to achieve <em>flow</em></li>\n</ul><p>Here&#8217;s more:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\n<p><em><strong><!-- more --></strong></em></p>\nHow To Produce Web-Based Happy Accidents</strong></em></p>\n<p>Serendipity is &#8220;too important a mechanism to ignore,&#8221; says Chris, but the way the web works is as a <strong>filter</strong> - designed to give a specific answer - which ignores serendipity. This is a linear approach.</p>\n<p>He sees his alternative as <strong><em>curatorial</em></strong> - designed to give an outcome in which the result is a collection of &#8220;objects&#8221;. The connections and analyses - that which ultimately produces the sagacity which in turn returns the value (to the beneficiary) of serendipity - are the consumer&#8217;s responsibility. The pathway branches.</p>\n<p><strong>A branching pathway is much more difficult to code because it doesn&#8217;t scale.</strong></p>\n<p>Chris believes that the question we must ask as consumers is how we want to discover.</p>\n<p>On this concept, our conversation turned to <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/\">Matt Jones</a>, co-founder of travel-based social networking site <a href=\"http://www.dopplr.com\">Dopplr</a> &amp; now one of the principles at London design studio <a href=\"http://berglondon.com\">Berg</a>. Matt <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/2009/02/18/exporting-the-past-into-the-future-or-the-possibility-jelly-lives-on-the-hypersurface-of-the-present/\">described my own predilection nicely</a> in a post about to maximise coincidence (note: I didn&#8217;t say serendipity) based on physical location. This tweet from his stream (in the post) sums it up nicely:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://magicalnihilism.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/twitter-_-matt-jones_-i-still-maintain-perhaps.png?w=676&amp;h=430\" align=\"middle\" height=\"291\" width=\"458\"/></p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://scraplab.net/2009/02/06/hereish-nowish/\">Hereish/Nowish/Soonish/Good Enough</a>&#8221; aren&#8217;t being built into technological solutions because there&#8217;s a fetishisation of precision. For example, we don&#8217;t get search results that seem off the mark; we discarded services that didn&#8217;t offer relevance long ago.</p>\n<p>In his post, Matt argues that the future cannot be automated, but future <em>coincidences</em> might occur because of the future intentionality Dopplr users share with people they trust.0240</p>\n<p>BUT. A <em>serendipitous</em> discovery might occur via Dopplr because the system&#8217;s accompanying &#8220;visualisations, tips,  statistics and other tools&#8221; allow you to &#8220;reflect on your past travels&#8221;. This is a bedrock upon which  sagacity might bloom. It produces the methods and materials for you to make the connections yourself, drawing on your self-knowledge.</p>\n<p>Chris wants developers to complicate their creations even more: forcing  awkward connections by juxtaposing &#8220;unrelated&#8221; (but <em>thematic</em>)  content. But this demands thoughtfulness from the perspective of the <strong>curator-developer</strong>. It means that they must blend the randomness in so people don&#8217;t think of it as error.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anti-Flow</strong></em></p>\n<p>Is the web itself the problem? We are so active as we traverse across it that we can&#8217;t experience the magnificent <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29\">flow</a></em> (<span class=\"citation book\">see <a href=\"http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4751.asp\">Csikszentmihalyi</a>&#8217;s publications)</span>, allowing our minds bimble as we do something else utterly immersive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Flow</strong> is the <a title=\"Mental state\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state\">mental state</a> of operation in which a person in  an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full  involvement, and success in the process of the activity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I experience flow most frequently when I&#8217;m running or cycling through the city streets. What is exceptionally flow-ful is that when I am utterly physically focussed on not getting killed by a taxi, a bus or a truck, my mind is able to wander and process something else. I guess this is <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/5219111468/an-incomplete-list-of-serendipity-necessities-v1\">what Steven Johnson means</a> when he says one of the ingredients in the Good Idea Recipe is to take A Creative Walk, or A Hot Bath.</p>\n<p><strong>We can&#8217;t do that online.</strong> We go online to find stuff out, to do things. Our HeadRAM is totally taken up with these tasks and cannot wander, process, make lateral connections. We are fully occupied, but not in a way that encourages us to think about or make sense of anything else.</p>\n<p>&#8212;-</p>\n<p>My big question is, <strong>do developers really <em>want</em> to create serendipity? I think the answer is no. </strong>I think they want to create discovery machines that provide solutions to consumers because that&#8217;s why consumers go to the Web.</p>\n<p>Discovery can be managed, engineered, programmed. Serendipity - occasionally the product of discovery - cannot.</p>", :title=>"Curating in the anti-Flow.

We talked about a lot of things - talks we&#8217;re giving, building materials we need, dream design projects we&#8217;d like to work on - but most importantly we decided two things:</p>\n<p>024002400240 42004202400240 0240how the Serendipity Engine fits into the Enquiry Machine series<br/>02400240 024042004202400240 0240what&#8217;s problematic about the processes the technologists are using to build their serendipity engines</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.enquirymachines.com/\">The Enquiry Machines series</a> (aka &#8220;instruments of enquiry&#8221;) seeks to render visible the processes of enquiry. As Kat describes, &#8220;by making something visible, you ask the audience to ask questions about it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Our starting point in this EM#2 is to take as a framework/starting point <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>the Web</strong>. In this research project we&#8217;re seeking to understand <em>how serendipity is currently missing from the knowledge production environment</em>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, <strong>we seek to disrupt a culture that</strong> (we feel) <strong>frames the serendipity experience as solution-driven</strong>: the &#8220;serendipity engine&#8221; that commercial digital organisations (from Google to Artfinder) are trying to create will answer questions about how to produce serendipitous answers and outcomes. The engines they will produce will be self-fulfilling because they will be embedded in the ideologies of what are considered valid and relevant &#8220;answers&#8221; and &#8220;outcomes&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Their inputs will anticipate their outputs.</strong></p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound like accidental discovery to me. Nor does it sound like sound science.</p>\n<p><strong>Furthermore, we have no idea what those inputs are, or what they  are (explicitly or implicitly) motivated by.</strong></p>\n<p>Full disclosure: this project does have an output that is defined as serendipity. This has been a matter of debate between Kat and I. But the way we have come to terms with this is that our approach will render visible the processes that lead to our defined serendipity outcome, <em>not</em> occlude them. Serendipity must be defined in order to establish the frame through  which to identify the variables that can be used to enquire about it.  The definition can necessarily include what it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><strong>The nature of the Enquiry Machines is to inquire about enquiry</strong>: the outcome is itself the question. Thus, the Serendipity Engine demands that the outcome be the realisation (or not) of serendipity.0240</p>\n<p>We are currently establishing the basic theoretical infrastructure, identifying the independent variables described in social theory (our particular specialty) that have been found to contribute to an outcome of serendipity.</p>\n<p>In future, we hope to expand this infrastructure by enlisting people from other disciplines, approaches, frameworks, cultures, perspectives (from particle physics to mathematics to baking to knitting to performance to sound to art to pathological lying) to help define the inputs that will go into the engine. The reason we will open this out is because any leaderboard of what best predicts a serendipitous outcome will very likely change with each new input. That&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>The process of enquiry is not fixed. That is the problem with digital solutions to human experiences.</strong><br/><br/></p>", :title=>"The problem with digital serendipity solutions: notes from a meeting", :external_id=>"8637791073", :created_at=>Mon Aug 08 08:46:00 +0100 2011, :post_type=>"regular", :source=>"tumblr", :url=>"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/8637791073/the-problem-with-digital-serendipity-solutions-notes", :byline=>nil, :thumbnail=>nil, :section_id=>"theserendipityengine", :locally_created_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :body=>nil, :locally_updated_at=>Tue Nov 01 22:50:53 +0000 2011, :updated_at=>Mon Aug 08 08:46:00 +0100 2011, :id=>1302, :api_url=>nil}>, #<Thoth::ExternalPost @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><em>cross-posted from <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/public-talks-sameas-serendipity-monday-8-august-2011\">alekskrotoski.com</a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/\">The  Serendipity Engine</a> gets its first outing on Monday 8 August at <a href=\"http://www.driverlondon.co.uk/\">The Driver</a> in London at <a href=\"http://sameas.us/events/serendipity\">sameAs</a>, an evening of  conversation and intellectual stimulation.

I am a social psychologist. I feel like I&#8217;m in a confessional. I am a social psychologist. And my bag, as it were, is social influence. Specifically, the influence that Web users exert over one another via the Web.</p>\n<p>My goodness, I can hear you say: that&#8217;s <i>exactly</i> our bread and butter! Well that&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s &#8211; at least on the surface &#8211; a very good fit.</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;m here to tell you that the Web that you are creating &#8211; through your apps and services, your content and campaigns &#8211; is broken, and it is breaking more every time you help someone find what they&#8217;re looking for online. <b>Everything you do that gives someone what they want (or, indeed, the appearance of something they want) is undermining the original ethos of the communication technology that is revolutionising how we interact with one another</b>.</p>\n<p>Before I go in for the kill, let me back up a little bit.</p>\n<p><b>The Web is Made of Tubes</b><br />\nThe Web is an agnostic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes\">series of tubes</a> &#8211; yes tubes &#8211; that allow us to communicate. It was developed, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/10/rushes-sequences-tim-bernersle.shtml\">Tim Berners-Lee said</a>, to fulfill a need: a very lazy need to get stuff from other people without needed to actually speak with them.</p>\n<p>What has fascinated me about this technology is how it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">holds a mirror up to us</a>: it tells us what we value, it tells us what we want, it tells us something almost essential about what it means to be human.</p>\n<p>In my own research, I&#8217;ve discovered that <i>we form groups and communities in this space for the exact same reasons as we do offline</i>: to belong, to feel safe, to find out how we define ourselves according to who we deem to be similar and who we deem to be different. We cluster around attitudes and behaviours, forming communities of practice that transcend national boundaries, colour, socio-economic status, creed, age or gender.</p>\n<p>This is the original ethos of the Web.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the science bit.</p>\n<p><b>The Science Bit: Online Relationships and Attitude &amp; Behaviour Change</b><br />\n<b>We form relationships for the same reasons as we do offline</b> &#8211; and in much the same way: we seek out people who are similar to ourselves, with whom we can share experiences that form the basis of strong emotional bonds. We choose to be friends with people we meet regularly, reciprocally divulging information about ourselves in a way that heightens our similarity to one another, and encourages us to divulge even more information.</p>\n<p>There is a difference here: the medium &#8211; because it&#8217;s computer-mediated and therefore has <i>fewer interpersonal cues than meeting in meatspace</i> &#8211; fosters the sense that we are somehow less prone to the consequences of our actions (whether we are anonymous or use our real names), and so &#8211; despite the headlines &#8211; we have a tendency to be <b>more open and honest with online friends</b> than with their offline counterparts, and <b>we believe other people are being more open an honest with us too</b>.</p>\n<p>This allows us to generate strong feelings of <b>trust</b> more rapidly online, which in turn leads to a sense that another person is <b>credible</b> source of information, which in turn leads to <b>influence</b>.</p>\n<p>In fact, <b>we do attitude and behaviour change in the same way as offline</b>: <i>we are influenced by the people we know whom we compare ourselves with</i>, and whom we view as typical of our social identities &#8211; that sense of who we are and which group we belong to.</p>\n<p>But because we have less information about the other people online &#8211; we have a tendency to <i>conform</i> to the attitudes and behaviours that people whom we (superficially) believe are more like us demonstrate.</p>\n<p>But even more fascinating, we are more likely to fill in the blanks about people&#8217;s attitudes based on what we think they think, often perceiving their attitudes as <i>more extremely similar</i> to ourselves than they actually are.</p>\n<p>And so what we have online is <b>social conformity based on a social pressure that more than likely doesn&#8217;t exist or is believed to be something than it is</b>.</p>\n<p>What a house of cards.</p>\n<p><b>Silencing Serendpity</b><br />\nSo what happens when you combine these tendencies with the extrordinary world wide web &#8211; an information repository so vast that it&#8217;s impossible to parse it in a meaningful way? A library of information that demands filters because it&#8217;s so enormous, otherwise it would be as utterly useless as a novel of words rearranged in a completely random order?</p>\n<p>How on earth does Joe or Jane Web user decide which content to look at and what to be influenced by?</p>\n<p>Well, as a social psychologist, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s <b>social influence</b>.</p>\n<p>And web developers are getting pretty wise to this. You don&#8217;t have to look far to see them trying to do it: first the focus of the success of a website was about getting eyeballs through developing community. More recently, it was about personalising search, and encouraging social searching services. The premise was that you&#8217;d be more likely to believe the information that was delivered to you from someone you viewed as similar, trustworthy and credible. And we already know how those form.</p>\n<p>Then came the next evolution of social searching &#8211; the phase we&#8217;re currently in now: social network searching. And it&#8217;s doing a phenomenal job of filtering the Web. <span class=\"caps\">CNN</span> proudly announced last month that <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-01/tech/social.network.news_1_social-networking-sites-social-media-social-experience?_s=PM:TECH\">75% of its news hits come from links on social networking services</a> like Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n<p>May I remind you that Facebook and Twitter are services that pair users with their friends.</p>\n<p>I would therefore say that what these services are doing is breaking the original ethos of Web.</p>\n<p><b>Losing the Vision</b><br />\nBack in the day, the pioneers who settled on the frontiers believed that we would open our minds to new and amazing things because of the vast quantities of information that we would have at our finger tips. And yes, thank you <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>, thank you the medium of mindlessly surfing, but I would propose that our courses through the Web &#8211; that seem at first random &#8211; are actually <i>determined by what we want to know and what we want to hear</i>.</p>\n<p>There are successful business models based exactly on this: amazon&#8217;s recommendation engine is a case in point. it gives you exactly what you think you want based on what it is that you already read &#8211; or what people who are similar to you already read &#8211; thus providing a more than certain sale and a good feeling overall.</p>\n<p>But this is ultimately leading to an <b>echo chamber</b>, which which we are deluded in thinking that <i>everyone else online thinks like we do, does what we do and believes what we do</i>. Our field of vision is narrowed and our differences become greater as we coagulate into different camps of interest.</p>\n<p>So much for the global group hug.</p>\n<p>Back in the day, the original founders of Web communities believed that the Web would be an engine of <b>self-actualisation</b>: that we would use the tools to play around with who we are, exploiting the apparent anonymity of the environment to try on new selves and use the open and honest feedback we received from other people to help shape our eventual attitudes and behaviours until we achieved the apex of our identities: our true selves.</p>\n<p>Well, what&#8217;s happened is that we have become fragmented, defined not only through the, frankly, obscene outpouring of information about ourselves that clogs the Web &#8211; I am more guilty than most &#8211; but by the links and tags and uploads that other people put up about us, forcing us instead of being the masters of our own fate, to be buffetted around by the tides of our online social exchanges.</p>\n<p><b>We are no longer the masters of our own virtual fates</b>: we now make decisions that are broadcast &#8211; willingly or unwillingly &#8211; in public, and recorded for posterity, which has a profound effect on what it is that we decide to do, the innovations we decide to adopt and the attitude we choose to express and hold.</p>\n<p>This is turning into doomsday predictions about the end of the world.</p>\n<p><b>How to Save the World</b><br />\nI assure you, I am not anti-the web. I make my business looking at the implications of it for the past, the present and potentially the future. I love it because it shows me the most extrordinary side of human beings: a face we have never before been able to see.</p>\n<p><b>But I would encourage you to stop and think before you deliver the next service, campaign or brand to your demographic on a plate.</b></p>\n<p>In order to ensure that the Web does not continue to break us, you must encourage <i>serendipity</i> &#8211; active and passive acts of randomness that make us better people, that bring us together with information that does not already confirm who we are, and does not restrict us ever more to being a demographic rather than individuals.</p>\n<p>Create services that <b>force people with different attitudes to bump up against one another</b>. Design systems that <b>force people to actively challenge information</b>. <b>Make it more difficult to be found</b>, so users have to navigate the rabbit holes of the Web to get to you.</p>\n<p>It may seem the antithesis of what it is you&#8217;re trying to do, but cracking a way to promote serendipity will be the <b>next greatest idea to come from this industry</b>. It will inspire new interactions with content and new narratives that will, in the end, make what you do more significant for the consumer. They will have had to find the end goal through their personal heroes journeys through the sea of Web stuff.</p>\n<p>And if it has a bonus feature of saving the world, you&#8217;ve done your good deed of the day.</p>\n<p><b>The End</b><br />\nWe are and can only be ourselves online because the Web is a communication tool. But it can be used to enhance us rather than restrict us. Use its interactivity to create new <i>connections</i>, new <i>stories</i> and new ways of <i>learning</i>. And that is when it will become a true revolution.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>", :title=>"[ENGAGE 2010] Supercharge your Serendipity", :created_at=>Thu Nov 18 09:28:41 +0000 2010, :sticky_tag_id=>nil, :body=>"I opened the <a href=\"https://www.iabuk.net/en/1/iabengage2010.html\">Internet Advertising Bureau's ENGAGE2010</a> summit in October (followed - intimidatingly - by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Bartz\">Carol Bartz, Yahoo!'s formidable CEO</a>) with a talk that aimed to provoke the advertising creatives in the room to consider what impact that their actions were having on the experiences of the people who consume the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\nIt proved a <a href=\"http://www.mad.co.uk/Logon/ArticleLogon.aspx?uiArticleID=1a673462-0d83-4ef4-86f6-f5a3be969a6b&uiNavigationItemID=&uiPageID=8453a00f-9d1a-404a-beda-339905b6b8b4&PipelinedPage=/Main/News/Articlex/1a6734620d834ef486f6f5a3be969a6b/Brands-should-think-before-they-advertise-online.html&PipelinedQueryString=uiArticleID%3d1a673462-0d83-4ef4-86f6-f5a3be969a6b%26uiNavigationItemID%3dd8f9fd23-813a-47b2-9696-31d9ca23a265%26\">controversial</a> <a href=\"http://www.iabuk.net/en/1/ukadvertiserscoulddobetter041110.mxs\">talk</a>, perhaps because I started out by saying that they were responsible for breaking the Web.\r\n\r\nWhat can I say, I was asked to provide a \"thought\" piece.

And we already know how those form.\r\n\r\nThen came the next evolution of social searching - the phase we're currently in now: social network searching. And it's doing a phenomenal job of filtering the Web. CNN proudly announced last month that <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-01/tech/social.network.news_1_social-networking-sites-social-media-social-experience?_s=PM:TECH\">75% of its news hits come from links on social networking services</a> like Facebook and Twitter. \r\n\r\nMay I remind you that Facebook and Twitter are services that pair users with their friends.\r\n\r\nI would therefore say that what these services are doing is breaking the original ethos of Web.\r\n\r\n<b>Losing the Vision</b>\r\nBack in the day, the pioneers who settled on the frontiers believed that we would open our minds to new and amazing things because of the vast quantities of information that we would have at our finger tips. And yes, thank you <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>, thank you the medium of mindlessly surfing, but I would propose that our courses through the Web - that seem at first random - are actually <i>determined by what we want to know and what we want to hear</i>.\r\n\r\nThere are successful business models based exactly on this: amazon's recommendation engine is a case in point. it gives you exactly what you think you want based on what it is that you already read - or what people who are similar to you already read - thus providing a more than certain sale and a good feeling overall.\r\n\r\nBut this is ultimately leading to an <b>echo chamber</b>, which which we are deluded in thinking that <i>everyone else online thinks like we do, does what we do and believes what we do</i>. Our field of vision is narrowed and our differences become greater as we coagulate into different camps of interest.\r\n\r\nSo much for the global group hug.\r\n\r\nBack in the day, the original founders of Web communities believed that the Web would be an engine of <b>self-actualisation</b>: that we would use the tools to play around with who we are, exploiting the apparent anonymity of the environment to try on new selves and use the open and honest feedback we received from other people to help shape our eventual attitudes and behaviours until we achieved the apex of our identities: our true selves.\r\n\r\nWell, what's happened is that we have become fragmented, defined not only through the, frankly, obscene outpouring of information about ourselves that clogs the Web - I am more guilty than most - but by the links and tags and uploads that other people put up about us, forcing us instead of being the masters of our own fate, to be buffetted around by the tides of our online social exchanges.\r\n\r\n<b>We are no longer the masters of our own virtual fates</b>: we now make decisions that are broadcast - willingly or unwillingly - in public, and recorded for posterity, which has a profound effect on what it is that we decide to do, the innovations we decide to adopt and the attitude we choose to express and hold.\r\n\r\nThis is turning into doomsday predictions about the end of the world.\r\n\r\n<b>How to Save the World</b>\r\nI assure you, I am not anti-the web. I make my business looking at the implications of it for the past, the present and potentially the future. I love it because it shows me the most extrordinary side of human beings: a face we have never before been able to see.\r\n\r\n<b>But I would encourage you to stop and think before you deliver the next service, campaign or brand to your demographic on a plate.</b>\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that the Web does not continue to break us, you must encourage <i>serendipity</i> - active and passive acts of randomness that make us better people, that bring us together with information that does not already confirm who we are, and does not restrict us ever more to being a demographic rather than individuals.\r\n\r\nCreate services that <b>force people with different attitudes to bump up against one another</b>. Design systems that <b>force people to actively challenge information</b>. <b>Make it more difficult to be found</b>, so users have to navigate the rabbit holes of the Web to get to you.\r\n\r\nIt may seem the antithesis of what it is you're trying to do, but cracking a way to promote serendipity will be the <b>next greatest idea to come from this industry</b>. It will inspire new interactions with content and new narratives that will, in the end, make what you do more significant for the consumer. They will have had to find the end goal through their personal heroes journeys through the sea of Web stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd if it has a bonus feature of saving the world, you've done your good deed of the day.\r\n\r\n<b>The End</b>\r\nWe are and can only be ourselves online because the Web is a communication tool. But it can be used to enhance us rather than restrict us. Use its interactivity to create new <i>connections</i>, new <i>stories</i> and new ways of <i>learning</i>. And that is when it will become a true revolution.\r\n\r\nThank you.", :name=>"engage-supercharge-your-serendipity", :updated_at=>Thu Nov 18 09:49:40 +0000 2010, :id=>193, :is_draft=>false}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p>I was interviewed by <a href=\"http://www.howitworksdaily.com/\">How It Works</a>, and they&#8217;ve kindly opened the content &#8211; normally published on dead trees &#8211; online.</p>\n<p>Because I chose my Canon 7D <span class=\"caps\">DSLR</span> as my favourite piece of gadgetry, some of my <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/lifestream-1984\">1984 photos</a> were published too.

For example, is it possible to quantify social capital in some way and then use that as the basis of a game to influence attitudes and behaviours? When I re-posed this question on Twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Matt Locke </a>at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Channel 4 Education</a> (a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/jul/15/develop-games-awards-2010\">publishing hero</a> that has an award-winning stable of games for change) was adamant that, &#8220;games may create social capital, but it&#8217;s not a game in itself&#8230; It&#8217;s dangerous to think of social capital as an asset that can be measured or created&#8230; social capital is a story, not data.&#8221; I&#8217;d love your take on it too.</p>\n<p><!-- fold --></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Hello and thank you very much for the warm invitation. When I found out I would be speaking with people who&nbsp; studied and designed ubiquitous computing, I must admit that I had a moment of panic. After all, you people are from the future, like the place inhabited by replicants and mechs and billboards that sense what you want and give it to you. That freaks me out. Frankly, you freak me out.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to retreat into a topic that I know something about and hopefully this will be of interest &#8211; and entertainment perhaps &#8211; to you, the people of the future, of what we were thinking about computers and digital technologies at the beginning of the 21st century. It was a time that was just beginning to grapple with the Internet &#8211; the most powerful communication tool known to civilization &#8211; and what it was that this tool taught us about ourselves as we left a wave of information about ourselves across the virtual ether.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a social psychologist, so I believe it is important to recognise what it is that can be understood through the data we leave behind in our daily lives &#8211; the digital footprint generated by our movements through virtual space, as it were. But I&#8217;m interested in the soft as well as the hard stuff that we can understand through our online activities. For me, the current volume of data available from our online activities is like finding the greatest treasure chest on the planet: finally &#8211; a phenomenal trove of human activity in natural settings that we can use to test theories about human behaviour and create new ones! In a natural environment! With real human responses! And no one acting differently because they feel they&#8217;re being watched by a lady in a white coat! Quick! Scrape everything, before the human subjects ethics committees realise!</p>\n<p>We know that our behaviours are captured online, and that these are used to create a digital identity that can be sold for corporate gain. The example of how Google pays for itself &#8211; through intel gleaned by slurping up our intentions &#8211; is a case in point. But it&#8217;s the softer, meat-space side that I&#8217;m interested in, how the ubiquity of computing will transform our relationships with one another and how we perceive ourselves. I feel these are important things to consider when designing applications and services that utilise ubiquitous computing, because of the social phenomena that emerge &#8211; through traceable or untraceable means &#8211; and what it is that, through more thoughtful design that includes features of social interaction, we can learn about humanity.</p>\n<p><b>active versus passive/computers versus meat-space</b><br />\nThere is currently, in most cases, a disconnect between us and the machine. Even in the case of Google, the best data capturing agent out there, we must be active in producing the information that they can use to generate our online identity. Their databases are full of our proactive behaviour, not our passive lives.</p>\n<p>So here we have a conflict between the digital space and the meat-space. I&#8217;d like to take a look at two of the things to think about when it comes to the bits that it&#8217;s more difficult to currently capture with digital technologies and when using the tech that&#8217;s coming close: the role of closeness, and how the feedback loop of constant updates is creating what I like to call a cult of me.</p>\n<p><b>the good old gooeyness of different types of friendship</b><br />\nFirst, let&#8217;s examine the basis of our social interactions: friendship. Friendship is simplest form of connection, and a feature of offline life that social networks in particular have exploited in their designs. In fact, they&#8217;re the basis of the business models that networks like Facebook and LinkedIn run on today: they operate on idea that individuals with friends will influence friends to join, thus increasing the value of the networks for themselves and for future customers. Facebook and LinkedIn then sell those connections on to highest bidders &#8211; in Facebook&#8217;s case, Microsoft &#8211; and you and your friends become the property of very rich organisations.</p>\n<p>Now, connection with people you care about or have similar interests with is what I believe is the basis for the success of the World Wide Web. It&#8217;s the social that made it more of a phenomenon than the simple library of information it provides.</p>\n<p>Of course, this wasn&#8217;t the original intention of the creators of the Web; Tim Berners-Lee did not think about this when he developed his hyper-text protocol. He&#8217;s an engineer and he was thinking about allowing people to connect with assets and content, not to one another. And so it&#8217;s up to social scientists like myself to try to understand how this very simple innovation became the vastly important interpersonal communication tool it is today. Even more importantly, it&#8217;s up to us to understand what it means for the offline person to be friends with someone else online.</p>\n<p>Anthropologists became the first people to really look at the communities that began to develop out of the technology as academics and fans, actually, of the Grateful Dead and others started interacting with one another via the Web. To the horror of the rest of the world, reports emerged about how human behaviours &#8211; like emotional connectedness, community, hierarchy, belongingness, stereotypes (the things that aren&#8217;t immediately obvious through binary digits) &#8211; were not only possible, but thrived in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>This is a controversial contention, of course. There are proponents &#8211; of course you can have meaningful friendships online &#8211; and there are detractors &#8211; how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space?</p>\n<p>Some of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they&#8217;re already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society&#8217;s annual conference.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you&#8217;ve never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it&#8217;s possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it&#8217;s even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>&#8216;s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a &#8217;communication closness&#8217;, and yes, it&#8217;s interesting, but I don&#8217;t think it captures everything.</p>\n<p>In fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who&#8217;s giving who money? That&#8217;s one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn&#8217;t know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, &#8220;Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Why is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another&#8217;s attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.<br />\n<b><br />\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b><br />\nSo I&#8217;ve talked about how it&#8217;s difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it&#8217;s actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?</p>\n<p>Well, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn&#8217;t mention, however, was that proximity &#8211; the experience of being &#8216;together&#8217; &#8211; is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are &#8216;close&#8217; not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online.

For example, is it possible to quantify social capital in some way and then use that as the basis of a game to influence attitudes and behaviours? When I re-posed this question on Twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Matt Locke </a>at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/matlock\">Channel 4 Education</a> (a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2010/jul/15/develop-games-awards-2010\">publishing hero</a> that has an award-winning stable of games for change) was adamant that, \"games may create social capital, but it's not a game in itself... It's dangerous to think of social capital as an asset that can be measured or created... social capital is a story, not data.\" I'd love your take on it too.\r\n\r\n<!-- fold -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHello and thank you very much for the warm invitation. When I found out I would be speaking with people who&nbsp; studied and designed ubiquitous computing, I must admit that I had a moment of panic. After all, you people are from the future, like the place inhabited by replicants and mechs and billboards that sense what you want and give it to you. That freaks me out. Frankly, you freak me out.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to retreat into a topic that I know something about and hopefully this will be of interest - and entertainment perhaps - to you, the people of the future, of what we were thinking about computers and digital technologies at the beginning of the 21st century. It was a time that was just beginning to grapple with the Internet - the most powerful communication tool known to civilization - and what it was that this tool taught us about ourselves as we left a wave of information about ourselves across the virtual ether.\r\n\r\nI'm a social psychologist, so I believe it is important to recognise what it is that can be understood through the data we leave behind in our daily lives - the digital footprint generated by our movements through virtual space, as it were. But I'm interested in the soft as well as the hard stuff that we can understand through our online activities. For me, the current volume of data available from our online activities is like finding the greatest treasure chest on the planet: finally - a phenomenal trove of human activity in natural settings that we can use to test theories about human behaviour and create new ones! In a natural environment! With real human responses! And no one acting differently because they feel they're being watched by a lady in a white coat! Quick! Scrape everything, before the human subjects ethics committees realise!\r\n\r\nWe know that our behaviours are captured online, and that these are used to create a digital identity that can be sold for corporate gain. The example of how Google pays for itself - through intel gleaned by slurping up our intentions - is a case in point. But it's the softer, meat-space side that I'm interested in, how the ubiquity of computing will transform our relationships with one another and how we perceive ourselves. I feel these are important things to consider when designing applications and services that utilise ubiquitous computing, because of the social phenomena that emerge - through traceable or untraceable means - and what it is that, through more thoughtful design that includes features of social interaction, we can learn about humanity.\r\n\r\n<b>active versus passive/computers versus meat-space</b>\r\nThere is currently, in most cases, a disconnect between us and the machine. Even in the case of Google, the best data capturing agent out there, we must be active in producing the information that they can use to generate our online identity. Their databases are full of our proactive behaviour, not our passive lives.\r\n\r\nSo here we have a conflict between the digital space and the meat-space. I'd like to take a look at two of the things to think about when it comes to the bits that it's more difficult to currently capture with digital technologies and when using the tech that's coming close: the role of closeness, and how the feedback loop of constant updates is creating what I like to call a cult of me.\r\n\r\n<b>the good old gooeyness of different types of friendship</b>\r\nFirst, let's examine the basis of our social interactions: friendship. Friendship is simplest form of connection, and a feature of offline life that social networks in particular have exploited in their designs. In fact, they're the basis of the business models that networks like Facebook and LinkedIn run on today: they operate on idea that individuals with friends will influence friends to join, thus increasing the value of the networks for themselves and for future customers. Facebook and LinkedIn then sell those connections on to highest bidders - in Facebook's case, Microsoft - and you and your friends become the property of very rich organisations.\r\n\r\nNow, connection with people you care about or have similar interests with is what I believe is the basis for the success of the World Wide Web. It's the social that made it more of a phenomenon than the simple library of information it provides.\r\n\r\nOf course, this wasn't the original intention of the creators of the Web; Tim Berners-Lee did not think about this when he developed his hyper-text protocol. He's an engineer and he was thinking about allowing people to connect with assets and content, not to one another. And so it's up to social scientists like myself to try to understand how this very simple innovation became the vastly important interpersonal communication tool it is today. Even more importantly, it's up to us to understand what it means for the offline person to be friends with someone else online.\r\n\r\nAnthropologists became the first people to really look at the communities that began to develop out of the technology as academics and fans, actually, of the Grateful Dead and others started interacting with one another via the Web. To the horror of the rest of the world, reports emerged about how human behaviours - like emotional connectedness, community, hierarchy, belongingness, stereotypes (the things that aren't immediately obvious through binary digits) - were not only possible, but thrived in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nThis is a controversial contention, of course. There are proponents - of course you can have meaningful friendships online - and there are detractors - how on earth can a lean medium full of anonymous users replace the physical and visceral richness of meat-space? \r\n\r\nSome of the people who are more cautious suggest that people can really only be friends online with those people who they're already connected with offline. <a href=\"http://www.shu.ac.uk/psychology/staff/reader.html\">Dr Will Reader</a>, from Sheffield Hallam University <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">made headlines with that announcement</a> a few years ago when he reported his pilot study to an audience of his peers at the British Psychological Society's annual conference. \r\n\r\nI'd like to come out on the side of the former: my own <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">research</a> and experience has demonstrated that it is possible to have strong emotional connections with people online that you've never met before, but that you spend time with in a community. And I also feel it's possible for these relationships to demonstrate a spectrum of closeness. And moreso, it's even possible to capture a very basic piece of that information by scraping behavioural data off the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to define closeness in networks (for more on this, check out <a href=\"http://patlab.ucc.ie/people.html#robcom\">Rob Comber</a>'s recent presentation at the <a href=\"http://www.bolton.ac.uk/conferences/cycomp2010/\">Cyberpsychology and Computers conference</a>) Technologically, some people choose to look at the number links between people, say hypertext links between blogs in the blogosphere, or the number of times people refer to one another in instant message chat. On a technology like <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a>, you can look to see who follows who, if the follower follows the followee (aka a reciprocal relationship), and, on top of that, how often they @ one another. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers\">Rogers</a> calls that a 'communication closness', and yes, it's interesting, but I don't think it captures everything.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I feel that if you want to get to the nitty gritty of what defines friendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness. Across a vast body of literature about online and offline closeness, I focus on trust. But how do you capture trust relationships through bits and bytes? By identifying who's giving who money? That's one way. But the more meat-space way is to ask, outright, who one trusts, or who one feels close to. That was what I had to do. \r\n\r\nI <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">studied</a> the people who use Second Life, the online virtual world that became very popular a few years ago. I asked over 750 users users of SL about their almost 6,000 connections. What I <a href=\"http://alekskrotoski.com/post/academic-dissertation---social-influence-in-second-life-social-n\">found</a> was that indeed, there was a spectrum of closeness relationships between people who didn't know one another offline, and that this closeness developed in the same way as offline friendships and relationships develop: through sharing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and through perceptions of similarity. Deb Levine wrote about this a decade ago in her paper, \"Virtual Attraction: What rocks your boat\".\r\n\r\nWhy is this interesting? Well, because many of the theories about how people influence one another's attitudes and behaviours focus on friendship. The closer the friendship, the more likely attitudes and behaviours will be similar. And if there is&nbsp; the possibility of people influencing one another online, we should understand how they operationalise friendship.\r\n<b>\r\nubiquitous computing and friendship</b>\r\nSo I've talked about how it's difficult for computers to capture our nuanced understanding of friendship, and why it's actually important to think about it. But how are our friendships affected by technologies that are almost ubiquitous (but still require our input), like Twitter?\r\n\r\nWell, as I said, people develop relationships online in a similar way as offline. One of the things I didn't mention, however, was that proximity - the experience of being 'together' - is also vastly important for both developing and maintaining relationships. I live in the UK, my parents and family live in the US. I have a sense that we are 'close' not just because of our histories, but also because we communicate regularly online. My mother, hilariously, sends me email responses to my twitter feeds and now uses words like 'nom nom nom' because I write that on my twitter updates.\r\n\r\nAlso, facilities like Twitter or Facebook or other social networks that are constantly updated give people a lot of information about which they can base a feeling of similarity on. Similarity online is a fascinating area. Because it's so lean, we have to rely on interpersonal cues that we extrapolate from the communication that's actively - proactively - distributed (check out more on this within the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Identity_model_of_Deindividuation_Effects_%28SIDE%29\">SIDE framework</a> from Martin Lea and Russell Spears). So, Facebook or Twitter updates give people minute-to-minute detail about what people are eating, the kinds of new stories they find important, who they're chatting with, the kinds of activities they take part in - and these help to form a basis of similarity. More likely it's a false basis - both because it's a constructed reality on the part of the person who's tweeting or updating, and because we as beasts insist on filling in the gaps with confirmatory content: stuff that makes us think that other people are actually more similar to ourselves than they really are.\r\n\r\nAnd here's a little aside - a cautionary tale, as it were - mine and others' research has shown that not only do we perceive people to be like us when they aren't (hold similar attitudes, do similar things), but we perceive them to be more extreme than us.

So here's a call to arms, clever future people: it's your job to create applications that can break this, to give us <b>serendipity</b> online, to force us to look at people we think are dissimilar, and to recognise that there are other views on the internet than those that are like ours.

She also charts how, out of the ashes, Google forged the business model that has come to dominate today&#8217;s web, offering a plethora of highly attractive, overtly free web services, including search, maps and video, that are in fact funded through a sophisticated and highly lucrative advertising system which trades on what we users look for.</p>\n<p>Aleks explores how web advertising is evolving further to become more targeted and relevant to individual consumers.

The programme looks at the dark corporate underbelly of the Web, and how it's transforming our notions of privacy and culture in the 21st century. It's also the one that excites me the most; I am a dystopian from way back, and I'm both thrilled and terrified to see how we have been complicit in our own <a href=\"http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/\">1984</a>. What does Google have on us? How is Amazon's recommendation system contradicting the most powerful opportunity for new inforamtion that the web offers - serendipity - and manipulating us into homogenous proles for its own benefit?\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vAeuxQuXXnw&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vAeuxQuXXnw&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nMagnificent. You can read more about these ideas in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/08/we-bought-the-eticket-were-tak.shtml\">my manifesto for this programme</a>, originally published on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution\">BBC's Digital Revolution blog</a> during pre-production.\r\n\r\nAs the film's Assistant Producer Jo Wade explains in an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8508814.stm\">article for the BBC today</a>, \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nEvery day in Britain millions of searches are carried out on Google for free. Every month we spend millions of hours on Facebook for free and read millions of articles from free newspapers.\r\n\r\nBut now look at it the other way round.\r\n\r\nEvery day Google gathers millions of search terms that help them refine their search system and give them a direct marketing bonanza that they keep for months.\r\n\r\nEvery week Facebook receives millions of highly personal status updates that are kept forever and are forming the basis of direct advertising revenue.\r\n\r\nEvery month free newspapers plant and track a cookie tracking device on your computer that tells them what your range of interests are and allows them to shape their adverts and in the future, even content around you.\r\n\r\nSo you're not just being watched, you're being traded. The currency has changed.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nFrom the official site:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn the third programme of the series, Aleks gives the lowdown on how, for better and for worse, commerce has colonised the web - and reveals how web users are paying for what appear to be 'free' sites and services in hidden ways.\r\n\r\nJoined by some of the most influential business leaders of today's web, including Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon), Eric Schmidt (CEO of Google), Chad Hurley (CEO of YouTube), Bill Gates, Martha Lane Fox and Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix), Aleks traces how business, with varying degrees of success, has attempted to make money on the web.\r\n\r\nShe tells the inside story of the gold rush years of the dotcom bubble and reveals how retailers such as Amazon learned the lessons. She also charts how, out of the ashes, Google forged the business model that has come to dominate today's web, offering a plethora of highly attractive, overtly free web services, including search, maps and video, that are in fact funded through a sophisticated and highly lucrative advertising system which trades on what we users look for.\r\n\r\nAleks explores how web advertising is evolving further to become more targeted and relevant to individual consumers. Recommendation engines, pioneered by retailers such as Amazon, are also breaking down the barriers between commerce and consumer by marketing future purchases to us based on our previous choices.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the web appears to have brought about a revolution in convenience. But, as companies start to build up databases on our online habits and preferences, Aleks questions what this may mean for our notions of privacy and personal space in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDon't forget, you can play the spot-the-programme-three-pics in the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/toastkid/sets/72157621257306475/\">production Flickr stream</a> while you watch, and I'll be on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">Twitter</a> as it broadcasts.", :name=>"virtual-revolution-the-cost-of-free", :updated_at=>Wed Feb 24 07:43:45 +0000 2010, :id=>147, :is_draft=>false}>, #<Thoth::Post @values={:body_rendered=>"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/24/internet-revolution-changing-world\">The Observer</a><br />\nSunday 24 January 2010</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm\">gave a speech on internet freedom</a> at a journalism museum in Washington, arguing that the architecture of the web must be free from censorship and manipulation.

And we discovered <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digitalrevolution/makingofprog4.shtml\">how the web is changing how we think and who we are</a>.</p>\n<p>I started the journey travelling through Ghana with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the unassuming Englishman who put the first website in history online on 6 August 1991. He was on a tour with the <a href=http://www.webfoundation.org/\">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, carrying out field research to understand how the web was affecting rural communities who were only now getting connected. He was modest about his role in the development of this technology, making sure to name-check the others who were toying with the same ideas at the same time. His aim had not been to catalyse a worldwide revolution, but to create a framework that would connect lots of information that would not require one person to look after it. But his idealism and belief in the power of web has driven him to take the web to the world.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tim Berners-Lee created a new mode of human communication,&#8221; Stephen Fry told me. &#8220;He created a new way of allowing communication to work in extraordinarily connected ways.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fry, <a href=\"http://www.stephenfry.com\">well-known for his enthusiasm for technology</a>, reflected on what the web had meant to him when he discovered it in the early 1990s. &#8220;It seemed like a great new world,&#8221; he enthused. &#8220;It seemed like a new democracy. It seemed like a new way of people coming together and spreading news, of educating, of giving yourself information and access to people and cultures and history. It seemed the most fantastic, radical and extraordinary development since Gutenberg produced his Bible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His thoughts were echoed by Al Gore, the former US vice-president. &#8220;It represents the emergence of a new information ecosystem that will have a more profound impact on human civilisation than did the printing press,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The web has brought about an enormous transformation in what information we have at our fingertips. It is extremely empowering: every0255one has the freedom to participate in the library of knowledge collected online, by accessing it or creating it. Anyone who has historically held control over the distribution of information 420023 governments, media, agents 420023 is having to reposition in the face of this information tsunami.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Individuals without great wealth or bases of power and the industrial world economy can exert influence on others who find their ideas resonating with them,&#8221; Gore said. &#8220;It is inherently democratising and egalitarian and promotes a greater role for the rule of reason.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is always dangerous, however, to be blinded by idealism. The web is undoubtedly a transformative technology on a par with the printing press, but it&#8217;s difficult to believe that it will bring the end of inequality or will eradicate international conflict. In fact, some have learned to manipulate the web&#8217;s power for their own ends.</p>\n<p>When this sits well with our personal politics, we celebrate. A <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/\">25-year-old from San Francisco</a> can create <a href=\"http://blog.austinheap.com/haystack-good-luck-finding-that-needle/\">a piece of software</a> that opens up a channel of communication on the violent streets of post-election Iran, giving protesters the ability to transmit what is happening to the rest of the world. Teenagers in London can <a href=\"http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/\">organise mass protests on climate change</a>, rallying people from around the country to march on a coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. But when the same techniques and tools are used to radicalise new recruits to fundamentalist causes, to attack a country&#8217;s banks and newspapers, or to promote propaganda within authoritarian states, the web becomes something to condemn.</p>\n<p>The debate becomes even more personal when you consider how our use of this overwhelmingly commercial space is transforming what privacy means in the 21st century. As we traipse across the web, our trails of personal information are captured and manipulated. We get services for free, but our actions are analysed to produce precisely targeted advertising that funds the companies behind the websites.</p>\n<p>The greatest shock to most people is that we willingly create this commercial pact when we think we&#8217;re alone. A Google search, for example, transcends the barrier between what we view as public and what we view as private. When we do a search on our computers at home, in the office or on the road, we have a misplaced sense we are transacting only with our machine. In fact, when we type a query in Google&#8217;s search box, we are divulging our intentions to a technology located across the planet, with hundreds of potential eyeballs sifting through our search terms for the perfect advertising match. Yet we still treat it like an oracle, asking it deeply personal questions and looking for answers in its computer brain.</p>\n<p>The surveillance implications for this are clear, but there are wider cultural implications when the money people behind the scenes get their rewards for feeding us exactly what we want. Amazon&#8217;s recommendation engine, Last.fm&#8217;s social music service, even news sites such as the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">Huffington Post</a>, reduce the possibility for serendipity by serving up what they think we want, channelling us into a loop of confirmation. As author <a href=\"http://rushkoff.com/\">Douglas Rushkoff</a> says: &#8220;The more like one of my kind of person I become, the less me I am, and the more I am a demographic type.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Socially, this is as potentially damaging as what the extremists peddle; we are coagulating into tight-knit groups who reinforce our own beliefs.

Simply, unlike the capacity to learn &#8211; which can be measured &#8211; social and psychological concepts that are difficult to measure, like serendipity, are too multifaceted to be programmed in a way that can scale for the current capacity of computer processors. Services that claim to generate serendipitous outcomes may produce something that mimics coincidence, but the attribution of serendipity is inherently too complex for current digital technologies to discern.</p>\n<p><b>defining the problem</b></p>\n<p>The problem is one of definition, and how to adequately represent this: such phenomena are socially, culturally, temporally, materially defined, thus databases that seek to reduce it by collecting data points and applying heuristic algorithms would expand exponentially if they tried to document as much as necessary to accurately replicate the serendipitous effect. Common constituents shared between people do help to locate an individual within certain parameters &#8211; country, demography, religious or political orientation, IQ, etc &#8211; but proportions of the components are unique to each person. Measuring the being human thus becomes a philosophical problem rather than a technological one.</p>\n<p>As we have discovered in the previous talks on this panel, serendipity is difficult to define because it relies upon the individual&#8217;s sense-making of a &#8220;happy accident&#8221; or the unexpected confluence of worlds (trickster). The current crop of &#8220;digital serendipity solutions&#8221; produce an avatar of &#8220;serendipity&#8221; based on discovery mechanism heuristics that do not account for the various environmental and individual elements that contribute to that attribution. Certainly the results might &#8220;pass&#8221; as serendipity, and this may be the desired effect for entities who wish to invest in this area, but their solutions are neither serendipitous nor scientific because the inputs they carer for pre-suppose a self-fulfilling &#8211; and non-accidental &#8211; outcome.</p>\n<p><b>how have</b></p>\n<p>Instead, a complex concept like serendipity can be more holistically represented and understood in a way that allows for what Law (2004) describes as &#8220;messiness,&#8221; or the array of elements that are difficult to reduce or to conventionally order or organise (Jungnickel, 2010).</p>\n<p>There are methods that seek to capture the messiness of human experience, particularly in the social sciences; for example, qualitative research analytic techniques in the psychological sciences, like Grounded Theory and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, seek to understand the experience of the individual, and ethnographic work, primarily used in sociology and anthropology, explore the sense-making processes employed by groups by examining texts and objects produced by participants in social systems. Yet even these methods fall short of being able to convey the outcomes, particularly because of the agendas and ideologies imbued in the written word (Sellen &amp; Harper, 2001; Krotoski, in press) as the resulting sense-making by the researcher(s) is commonly reduced into text-based interpretations that are static.</p>\n<p><b>how to &#8220;make sense&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>An alternative method, practiced by Jungnickel and McHardy (2010) explores dynamic systems of sense-making by producing physical interpretations of data and theory, encouraging an ongoing, collaborative and reflexive understanding of the aspects of experience we are unable to measure or control. They are creating a series of &#8220;Enquiry Machines&#8221; that are an assemblage of human, non-human and conceptual components aimed at, &#8220;drawing attention to the material nature of enquiry420046 an attempt to critically examine practice420046a metaphor in action.&#8221;</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/15224631?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/15224631\">Enquiry Machine #1 &#8211; Making</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/katjung\">Kat Jungnickel</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>\n<p>The function of performative methods that &#8220;make real&#8221; are multifold, serving the researchers&#8217; sense-making and demonstrating the viewers and users the conceptual complexity involved in the social phenomenon under consideration.

It is an &#8220;engine&#8221; rather than a machine because, although it has a form and a function with a purpose &#8211; to render visible the cultural, temporal and material processes in generating a serendipitous outcome &#8211; it will transform the essential properties of the input. It will irrevocably convert the ins and transform them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine.</p>\n<p><i>It will change the nature of chance by inspiring insight in order that value is attributed to the experience.</i></p>\n<p>The &#8220;engine&#8221; will have three forms:</p>\n<p>1) Jungnickel and I will develop a physical &#8220;core&#8221; that is based upon the current body of research that seeks to define the socio-cultural, psychological, technological and material nature of serendipity. This will be a dynamic and interactive entity made from scrounged materials, curated to represent &#8220;mess&#8221;. Our interpretation will focus on the &#8220;insight&#8221; element of the definition evolved by the SerenA project and other research in this area.</p>\n<p>This will represent the social and psychological discourse upon which interpretations of value will subsequently be added.</p>\n<p>2) To emphasise the locativity of the definition, we will seek &#8220;apps&#8221; from practitioners in different countries that can be appended to the core engine. These will demonstrate to users that the interpretations of serendipity are locally oriented.</p>\n<p>3) There will be a series of open salon events in which commissioned artists, researchers and others will be asked to create a perforative piece or lecture for a public audience that is based on their interpretation of the theme &#8220;serendipity&#8221;. The objective is to &#8220;generate&#8221; serendipitous encounters between attendees across four dimensions: inspired by the interaction between audience member and object, between audience member and presenter, audience members inspired by object, and audience members not inspired by object.</p>\n<p>This form is closest to the solutions designed by engineers, subject to the curatorial filtering and considered placement of &#8220;inputs&#8221; (commissioned presenters) in order to produce output.</p>\n<p><b>conclusion</b></p>\n<p>As a technology, the Serendipity Engine seeks to insert messiness into the process of defining a value-laden human phenomenon. Through the process of forming and re-forming this analogue &#8220;solution&#8221; for a problem that is increasingly gaining value amongst commercial software developers, the aim is to render visible other factors that could produce more inclusive digital technologies that better-represent being human in code.</p>\n<p><b>references</b><br />\nJungnickel, K.

The good news is that <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/11057400816/a-user-centred-mobile-diary-study-approach-to\">they are too</a>.\r\n\r\nHere's the talk I gave at the panel:\r\n\r\n<b>Beautiful Machines: A sense-making methodology for serendipitous discovery</b>\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive research exploring how to build digital technologies that can mimic human processes like learning and logic, but this paper takes as its starting point that the phenomenological experience of being human is not replicable in the digital environment. Simply, unlike the capacity to learn - which can be measured - social and psychological concepts that are difficult to measure, like serendipity, are too multifaceted to be programmed in a way that can scale for the current capacity of computer processors. Services that claim to generate serendipitous outcomes may produce something that mimics coincidence, but the attribution of serendipity is inherently too complex for current digital technologies to discern. \r\n\r\n<b>defining the problem</b>\r\n\r\nThe problem is one of definition, and how to adequately represent this: such phenomena are socially, culturally, temporally, materially defined, thus databases that seek to reduce it by collecting data points and applying heuristic algorithms would expand exponentially if they tried to document as much as necessary to accurately replicate the serendipitous effect. Common constituents shared between people do help to locate an individual within certain parameters - country, demography, religious or political orientation, IQ, etc - but proportions of the components are unique to each person. Measuring the being human thus becomes a philosophical problem rather than a technological one.\r\n\r\nAs we have discovered in the previous talks on this panel, serendipity is difficult to define because it relies upon the individual's sense-making of a \"happy accident\" or the unexpected confluence of worlds (trickster). The current crop of \"digital serendipity solutions\" produce an avatar of \"serendipity\" based on discovery mechanism heuristics that do not account for the various environmental and individual elements that contribute to that attribution. Certainly the results might \"pass\" as serendipity, and this may be the desired effect for entities who wish to invest in this area, but their solutions are neither serendipitous nor scientific because the inputs they carer for pre-suppose a self-fulfilling - and non-accidental - outcome.\r\n\r\n<b>how have</b>\r\n\r\nInstead, a complex concept like serendipity can be more holistically represented and understood in a way that allows for what Law (2004) describes as \"messiness,\" or the array of elements that are difficult to reduce or to conventionally order or organise (Jungnickel, 2010). \r\n\r\nThere are methods that seek to capture the messiness of human experience, particularly in the social sciences; for example, qualitative research analytic techniques in the psychological sciences, like Grounded Theory and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, seek to understand the experience of the individual, and ethnographic work, primarily used in sociology and anthropology, explore the sense-making processes employed by groups by examining texts and objects produced by participants in social systems. Yet even these methods fall short of being able to convey the outcomes, particularly because of the agendas and ideologies imbued in the written word (Sellen & Harper, 2001; Krotoski, in press) as the resulting sense-making by the researcher(s) is commonly reduced into text-based interpretations that are static. \r\n\r\n<b>how to \"make sense\"</b>\r\n\r\nAn alternative method, practiced by Jungnickel and McHardy (2010) explores dynamic systems of sense-making by producing physical interpretations of data and theory, encouraging an ongoing, collaborative and reflexive understanding of the aspects of experience we are unable to measure or control. They are creating a series of \"Enquiry Machines\" that are an assemblage of human, non-human and conceptual components aimed at, \"drawing attention to the material nature of enquiry420046 an attempt to critically examine practice420046a metaphor in action.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/15224631?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/15224631\">Enquiry Machine #1 - Making</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/katjung\">Kat Jungnickel</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\nThe function of performative methods that \"make real\" are multifold, serving the researchers' sense-making and demonstrating the viewers and users the conceptual complexity involved in the social phenomenon under consideration. The processes which Jungnickel documents in her ethnographic performative practices, including the development of Enquiry Machine No 1, \"open[s] up alternate means of interrogating [her] ideas.\" She describes the reflexivity for the researcher involved in the choice of materials, the spatial configurations and the locations of display and the \"messy, dynamic and collaboratively produced\" evolution of the meaning of the research objects (including text, video, imagery, physical object) as viewers make \"informal and serendipitous connections\" and transform the display.\r\n\r\n<b>making sense for them</b>\r\n\r\n!http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wkgIzuqJM0w/TN_BiBwPxjI/AAAAAAAAHLM/Fz3DYjKKeiU/strogatz.detailed.533.jpg!:http://www.zerohedge.com/article/welcome-machine\r\n\r\nThe sense-making by individuals towards the content is also represented in other machines that have had research and artistic agendas. The MONIAC computer was an analogue computer devised and built by a sociology graduate with an interest in economic principles as a demonstration tool for classrooms, and which became a predictive tool for governments and commercial organisations. \r\n\r\nCreated in 1949 by William Phillips in his spare time, the MONIAC is approximately 2 metres high, 1 metre wide and 1 metre deep. Its components include a series of found transparent plastic tanks and pipes affixed to a wooden board that contained different-coloured water that flowed between tanks to represent economic principles and the setting for economic parameters like tax and investment rates. It made visible the hidden inter-relationships between variables. Phillips' computer was his method for translating the language of economics into hydraulics, \"from a language he didn't understand into a language which he did.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bXBuWUQ24vU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThe computer succeeded in its objective: \"It was such a supreme visual telling of the mechanics of the Keynsian idea that I think all students felt for the first time they started to understand what the basic ideas were all about.\" Dr Brian Henry, Director of the Centre for the Centre for International Macroeconomics, Oxford University\r\n\r\n<b>making sense for her</b>\r\n\r\n!http://dbprng00ikc2j.cloudfront.net/work/image/188183/abagl8/forgiveness_machine_1.jpg!:http://www.beautifulcrap.com\r\n\r\nArtist Karen Green's series of prints of fictional machines represents another kind of sense-making different from Phillips', Jungnickel's and McHardy's: their objects explained \"objective\" principles by seeking to unpick the principles according to theory, while Green's machines represent a sense-making that is subjective and intended to represent a personal working-through of a concept. The Forgiveness Machine was developed in response to her husband's suicide and the need to process that event. \"420034The forgiveness machine was seven-feet long,420035 she says, 420034with lots of weird plastic bits and pieces. Heavy as hell.420035 The idea was that you wrote down the thing that you wanted to forgive, or to be forgiven for, and a vacuum sucked your piece of paper in one end. At the other it was shredded, and hey presto.\" When physically re-created and put on display in an art gallery, the reaction had qualities similar to the machines previously described, instilling a sense of connection with the principles on display (emotional, conceptual).\r\n\r\n<i>The machine was overwhelmed, too; it couldn't process all the requests and was eventually dismantled. \"Forgiving is never as easy as we would like,\" she says. \"Apparently quite a lot of people cried.\"</i> \r\n- <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/10/karen-green-david-foster-wallace-interview\">The Guardian, 11 April 2011</a>\r\n\r\n<b>making sense of serendipity</b>\r\n\r\nThe Serendipity Engine, a collaboration with Jungnickel, is the second in the Enquiry Machine series, and similarly seeks to render visible the multiple socio-material-technical (and I would add, psychological) processes that are invested in the attribution of serendipity. It is an \"engine\" rather than a machine because, although it has a form and a function with a purpose - to render visible the cultural, temporal and material processes in generating a serendipitous outcome - it will transform the essential properties of the input. It will irrevocably convert the ins and transform them into brand new outs that serve the function, purpose and performance of the machine. \r\n\r\n<i>It will change the nature of chance by inspiring insight in order that value is attributed to the experience.</i>\r\n\r\nThe \"engine\" will have three forms: \r\n\r\n1) Jungnickel and I will develop a physical \"core\" that is based upon the current body of research that seeks to define the socio-cultural, psychological, technological and material nature of serendipity. This will be a dynamic and interactive entity made from scrounged materials, curated to represent \"mess\". Our interpretation will focus on the \"insight\" element of the definition evolved by the SerenA project and other research in this area. \r\n\r\nThis will represent the social and psychological discourse upon which interpretations of value will subsequently be added.\r\n\r\n2) To emphasise the locativity of the definition, we will seek \"apps\" from practitioners in different countries that can be appended to the core engine. These will demonstrate to users that the interpretations of serendipity are locally oriented.\r\n\r\n3) There will be a series of open salon events in which commissioned artists, researchers and others will be asked to create a perforative piece or lecture for a public audience that is based on their interpretation of the theme \"serendipity\". The objective is to \"generate\" serendipitous encounters between attendees across four dimensions: inspired by the interaction between audience member and object, between audience member and presenter, audience members inspired by object, and audience members not inspired by object.\r\n\r\nThis form is closest to the solutions designed by engineers, subject to the curatorial filtering and considered placement of \"inputs\" (commissioned presenters) in order to produce output.\r\n\r\n<b>conclusion</b>\r\n\r\nAs a technology, the Serendipity Engine seeks to insert messiness into the process of defining a value-laden human phenomenon. Through the process of forming and re-forming this analogue \"solution\" for a problem that is increasingly gaining value amongst commercial software developers, the aim is to render visible other factors that could produce more inclusive digital technologies that better-represent being human in code.\r\n\r\n<b>references</b>\r\nJungnickel, K.

It&#8217;s been an inspiring year.</p>\n<p>For my next column, I&#8217;ve decided to marry my multiple interests and write about serendipity. Here&#8217;s my blurb from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/aug/11/untangling-web-serendipity-twitter-social-network-web\">The Guardian&#8217;s technology blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Serendipity, the enigmatic process that&#8217;s been credited with  producing everything from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/serendipity.shtml\">penicillin  to the chocolate chip cookie</a>, is the almost-magical convergence of a  (happy) accident and the sagacity of knowing what to do with it.</p>\n<p>The  web has been described by some pundits as &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2006/05/can_we_please_k.html\">the  greatest serendipity engine in the history of culture</a>&#8221;, and  commercial companies - <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/28/eric-schmidt-future-of-search/\">like  Google</a> - are looking to harvest your enormous cloud of data to  deliver serendipitous experiences before you even know what to search  for.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2011/05/12/chi-keynote-desperately-seeking-serendipity/\">other  pundits</a> have decried the web&#8217;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Pariser\">filtering mechanics</a> for reducing serendipity, and potentially stifling innovation rather  than creating it.</p>\n<p>So who&#8217;s right? Is the web a serendipity machine  or a tool for cultural homogenisation? Or is it, like so many things,  not nearly so black and white?</p>\n<p>This fortnight, I tackle a pet  topic: what <em>is</em> the web doing for (or against) serendipity.  Follow the progress on the <a href=\"http://untanglingtheweb.tumblr.com/\">Untangling  the Web blog</a> for all the links, interviews, photos, videos,  articles and academic research on serendipity and the web that will feed  this article.</p>\n<p>Send your thoughts to <a href=\"mailto:aleks.krotoski.freelance@guardian.co.uk\">aleks.krotoski.freelance@guardian.co.uk</a>,  comment below, or @ me on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk\">@aleksk</a>.

We have a mutual obsession with serendipity.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, many of our conversations have glanced on the concept; some have been recorded for posterity (on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2011/may/03/tech-weekly-art-love-bin-laden\">The Guardian&#8217;s Tech Weekly podcast</a> and on social media), others have been lost in the ephemera of meatspace. And while Chris concurs with my blue-sky social scientific conceptualisation, his work as a programmer has placed pragmatic limitations on how serendipity can actually be applied in cold, hard, binary (virtual) reality.</p>\n<p>Chris&#8217; work as a research scientist/technologist has evolved into an interest in large databases and the ways they can be used to help people discover new things. Case in point, Artfinder is a service that, using a database of all of the art in museums around the world, ostensibly helps people bump up into new art that they would probably like.</p>\n<p>This precisely sums up my problem with so-called digital serendipity solutions. And so this is precisely what Chris, Kat and I talked about.</p>\n<p>In the process, we landed on two key things:</p>\n<ul><li>to maximise the experience of happy accidents, web designers should curate not-quite-right solutions and let consumers do the processing</li>\n<li>it&#8217;s possible to produce coincidence online, but it&#8217;s <em>not</em> possible to engineer serendipity because we are always too active to achieve <em>flow</em></li>\n</ul><p>Here&#8217;s more:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\n<p><em><strong><!-- more --></strong></em></p>\nHow To Produce Web-Based Happy Accidents</strong></em></p>\n<p>Serendipity is &#8220;too important a mechanism to ignore,&#8221; says Chris, but the way the web works is as a <strong>filter</strong> - designed to give a specific answer - which ignores serendipity. This is a linear approach.</p>\n<p>He sees his alternative as <strong><em>curatorial</em></strong> - designed to give an outcome in which the result is a collection of &#8220;objects&#8221;. The connections and analyses - that which ultimately produces the sagacity which in turn returns the value (to the beneficiary) of serendipity - are the consumer&#8217;s responsibility. The pathway branches.</p>\n<p><strong>A branching pathway is much more difficult to code because it doesn&#8217;t scale.</strong></p>\n<p>Chris believes that the question we must ask as consumers is how we want to discover.</p>\n<p>On this concept, our conversation turned to <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/\">Matt Jones</a>, co-founder of travel-based social networking site <a href=\"http://www.dopplr.com\">Dopplr</a> &amp; now one of the principles at London design studio <a href=\"http://berglondon.com\">Berg</a>. Matt <a href=\"http://magicalnihilism.com/2009/02/18/exporting-the-past-into-the-future-or-the-possibility-jelly-lives-on-the-hypersurface-of-the-present/\">described my own predilection nicely</a> in a post about to maximise coincidence (note: I didn&#8217;t say serendipity) based on physical location. This tweet from his stream (in the post) sums it up nicely:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://magicalnihilism.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/twitter-_-matt-jones_-i-still-maintain-perhaps.png?w=676&amp;h=430\" align=\"middle\" height=\"291\" width=\"458\"/></p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http://scraplab.net/2009/02/06/hereish-nowish/\">Hereish/Nowish/Soonish/Good Enough</a>&#8221; aren&#8217;t being built into technological solutions because there&#8217;s a fetishisation of precision. For example, we don&#8217;t get search results that seem off the mark; we discarded services that didn&#8217;t offer relevance long ago.</p>\n<p>In his post, Matt argues that the future cannot be automated, but future <em>coincidences</em> might occur because of the future intentionality Dopplr users share with people they trust.0240</p>\n<p>BUT. A <em>serendipitous</em> discovery might occur via Dopplr because the system&#8217;s accompanying &#8220;visualisations, tips,  statistics and other tools&#8221; allow you to &#8220;reflect on your past travels&#8221;. This is a bedrock upon which  sagacity might bloom. It produces the methods and materials for you to make the connections yourself, drawing on your self-knowledge.</p>\n<p>Chris wants developers to complicate their creations even more: forcing  awkward connections by juxtaposing &#8220;unrelated&#8221; (but <em>thematic</em>)  content. But this demands thoughtfulness from the perspective of the <strong>curator-developer</strong>. It means that they must blend the randomness in so people don&#8217;t think of it as error.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Anti-Flow</strong></em></p>\n<p>Is the web itself the problem? We are so active as we traverse across it that we can&#8217;t experience the magnificent <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29\">flow</a></em> (<span class=\"citation book\">see <a href=\"http://www.cgu.edu/pages/4751.asp\">Csikszentmihalyi</a>&#8217;s publications)</span>, allowing our minds bimble as we do something else utterly immersive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Flow</strong> is the <a title=\"Mental state\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state\">mental state</a> of operation in which a person in  an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full  involvement, and success in the process of the activity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I experience flow most frequently when I&#8217;m running or cycling through the city streets. What is exceptionally flow-ful is that when I am utterly physically focussed on not getting killed by a taxi, a bus or a truck, my mind is able to wander and process something else. I guess this is <a href=\"http://theserendipityengine.tumblr.com/post/5219111468/an-incomplete-list-of-serendipity-necessities-v1\">what Steven Johnson means</a> when he says one of the ingredients in the Good Idea Recipe is to take A Creative Walk, or A Hot Bath.</p>\n<p><strong>We can&#8217;t do that online.</strong> We go online to find stuff out, to do things. Our HeadRAM is totally taken up with these tasks and cannot wander, process, make lateral connections. We are fully occupied, but not in a way that encourages us to think about or make sense of anything else.</p>\n<p>&#8212;-</p>\n<p>My big question is, <strong>do developers really <em>want</em> to create serendipity? I think the answer is no. </strong>I think they want to create discovery machines that provide solutions to consumers because that&#8217;s why consumers go to the Web.</p>\n<p>Discovery can be managed, engineered, programmed. Serendipity - occasionally the product of discovery - cannot.</p>", :title=>"Curating in the anti-Flow.
